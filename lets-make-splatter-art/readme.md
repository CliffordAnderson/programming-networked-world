# Creating Abstract Circles with NetsBlocks and Variables

Welcome back, everyone! In this lesson, we'll be using **NetsBlocks** to draw a painting with circles of varying sizes to mimic contemporary art. Along the way, we'll explore the concept of _variables_, which allow us to efficiently use data in our programs. We'll also learn a few NetsBlocks tips and tricks to improve our program execution.

The fundamental element of computer graphics is the _pixel_, a single dot on a computer screen. By relating pixels on a two-dimensional matrix, computers create graphical images. In this exercise, we will simulate drawing with pixels by using circles combined on stage to generate a work of art. To do this, we will create circles of various sizes using the concept of variables to store different radius values.

We will also be making our painting more visually appealing by changing the colors as we draw. By implementing random blocks, we can adjust the color of our circles slightly each time. This will give the illusion of continuity in our painting. Alongside the use of variables and control blocks, we have created a detailed, abstract expressionist painting.

## Key takeaways from this lesson:

- We used **NetsBlocks** to create circles of varying sizes on a stage, simulating contemporary art.
- The concept of _variables_ was introduced to efficiently use and update data within our programs.
- We learned a few NetsBlocks tips and tricks, such as hiding the sprite, using Turbo Mode, and bouncing off edges, to improve program execution and appearance.
- Combining different control blocks and random blocks, we enhanced our painting with more detail and color variation.
- In the end, we created an abstract expressionist painting using variables, control blocks, and random blocks in NetsBlocks.
