# Introduction to Starting Course Assignments

Hello everyone, today we're going to learn how to begin the assignments for our course. First, you'll need to click the link in the assignment description. This will take you to *Netsbox*, where you'll notice an *extensions button* at the top center, represented by a little puzzle piece. Clicking on this button will reveal an option for *programming for NetworkWorld*.

Once you've selected that option, you should see a list of assignments available for the course. When starting an assignment, simply select it from this list and a starter template will appear. Most templates will have a custom block that you need to open and implement. Begin implementing the block by right-clicking on it and selecting *edit*. This will open up a block editor where you can write the necessary code to implement the block.

As you're working on your solution, you can evaluate your progress by selecting the extensions button and navigating to the programming for a networked world menu. Here, you'll find options to *grade your assignment* and *submit the assignment*. Grading your assignment will show you a list of tests and their pass/fail status. If you're happy with your results, you can submit the assignment by entering your Coursera email address and the token provided on the Coursera website when you went to submit the assignment.
