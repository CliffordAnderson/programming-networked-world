00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,080
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,480
Welcome back to Programming for a Networked World.

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,200
Today, we're continuing our exploration

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,840
of textual analysis by doing frequency analysis

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,760
over letters in particular texts.

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,520
So this is part two of a video.

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,360
If you haven't seen part one, you

8
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,640
should go back and view that first.

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,400
Today, we're just going to be continuing

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,000
with our exploration of the frequency patterns

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,520
in various texts and comparing them to the overall frequency

12
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,400
of letters in particular languages.

13
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,800
And our goal today is to visualize the results.

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,120
So ready to graph our frequencies?

15
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:35,880
Let's get started.

16
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,960
Here's where we were.

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,560
This is where we left off last time.

18
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,600
And if you remember, we are gathering the letter frequencies

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,200
for various languages here.

20
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,680
And then we're getting a particular text

21
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,560
from Project Gutenberg.

22
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,880
We are splitting that text up according

23
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:03,000
to the frequency in the book, getting the letters

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,400
and seeing how frequently they appear in the book.

25
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,880
And then we're getting the count of those letters,

26
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,240
and then the percentage of those letters,

27
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,560
and then assigning this to that percentage of letters

28
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,840
frequency variable.

29
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,640
So our goal, as I said, is to be able to graph our results.

30
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,880
And we need to do two things.

31
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,560
We want to graph the results that we're getting here

32
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,680
from this particular book.

33
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,120
And we also want to graph the results that

34
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,720
serve our baseline comparison from whatever language

35
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,320
we think the book may be written in.

36
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,160
So let's actually start with the baseline comparison.

37
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,360
So I'm going to go over here to we

38
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,480
have a variable that's over here, letter frequencies.

39
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,000
Let's just take a look at this.

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,080
When I click on this, I get that big chart.

41
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,480
And so we need to get rid of that chart.

42
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,400
And the way to do that is just we

43
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,440
want to pull out a particular language.

44
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:58,200
So let's grab, let's see here, a couple of blocks to do that.

45
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,560
We're going to need this item of.

46
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,440
And we're also going to need the higher order block here,

47
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,120
map over.

48
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:13,720
And so let's just take this here and put that there.

49
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:20,240
We want item four of the list.

50
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,080
And let's see how this works.

51
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,560
There.

52
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,000
So this pulls out, you can see here, German.

53
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,400
And then here are the frequencies for A, B, C, D, E,

54
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,920
and so forth in German.

55
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,840
And if we switch this to number five, we've got Spanish now.

56
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,400
So each time we switch this number,

57
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,600
and I think probably two is going to be English.

58
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,440
There we go.

59
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,840
So each time we use this, we get a different language

60
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,360
and its frequency of letters in that language just overall.

61
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,120
Now, you notice that we do also get the language name.

62
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,800
And we don't actually want that in our results

63
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,320
because we need to just work with the numbers themselves.

64
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,400
So we're going to use this convenient block called

65
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,240
allbutfirst.

66
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,200
It's a pretty common operation to divide lists

67
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,840
into head or tail of the list.

68
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,600
And the head is the first item in the list,

69
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,180
and the tail is the rest of the items.

70
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,560
So this just gets the tail of the list.

71
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,080
And if we click on that, then you can see that we have a list

72
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,840
here that goes from 1 to 26.

73
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,680
So that's our letter frequency for English.

74
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,080
So that's fantastic.

75
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,400
Now we just need to assign that to a variable.

76
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,560
So let's go over here.

77
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,980
We'll just make a script variable,

78
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:33,800
and we'll say baseline letter frequency.

79
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,880
And there we go.

80
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,520
And let's just put this.

81
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,800
We need to put it after we set the letter frequency.

82
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,960
So let's put a block in to set that.

83
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,440
Right here is probably the best place to do it.

84
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,880
Say baseline letter frequency.

85
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,840
And then we'll drop this into it.

86
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,240
So now we should have the frequencies

87
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,320
from the actual text that we're looking at as well

88
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,800
as our baseline frequencies, and we just need to graph them.

89
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,720
Now, to remember, we've done this before.

90
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,080
I'm going to go over to network.

91
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,680
We're going to see if I get more space here.

92
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:23,040
And we want to get this variable here or this block here.

93
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,440
And let's drop down to graph.

94
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,640
Let's see here.

95
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,920
There's a chart service, I think, is what it's called.

96
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,880
There we go.

97
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,360
And the chart service, if you recall,

98
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,400
has a set of default options already built in.

99
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,360
We're going to want to tweak these options,

100
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,840
but let's go with them for now.

101
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,640
So that'll just be our starting point.

102
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:50,640
And then let's duplicate this.

103
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,600
And there we go, a little bit more space.

104
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,960
Let's drop this down to just draw.

105
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,240
So draw takes the lines that we want to graph here

106
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,160
as well as the options.

107
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,360
So we can just drop the options in there for now.

108
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,240
And we have two things that we want to chart.

109
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,720
We want to chart the percentage of letters frequency

110
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,880
as well as the baseline letter frequency.

111
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,600
So to do that, we're going to pass in a list

112
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,080
with both of those there.

113
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,080
So we'll bring this over here.

114
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,920
We're going to open up another slot.

115
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,200
And let's pull them in.

116
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,320
So baseline letter frequency, we'll pull in first.

117
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,560
And then the percentage of letter frequency,

118
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,720
we'll in second.

119
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,720
And then we're going to report this.

120
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,040
Well, actually, don't want to report it, right?

121
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,800
We just want to visualize it on the stage.

122
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,240
So I'm going to throw this off to the side.

123
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:49,520
And let's pull down Looks here, switch to Costume,

124
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,160
because we want to actually switch to the charting service.

125
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,400
And Ada will disappear.

126
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,480
And our chart should appear if it worked correctly.

127
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,600
Just to make this work more smoothly,

128
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,720
we'll put a when clicked on top here to kick it all off.

129
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,720
There we go.

130
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,480
All right, so it's getting more complicated.

131
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,440
Let's see if it works.

132
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,480
All right, going out and getting the book,

133
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:17,760
getting the frequencies of the letters in the book.

134
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:22,880
And if it all works well, we should see a chart appear

135
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,920
fairly soon.

136
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,800
Still running, so not yet.

137
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,600
There we go.

138
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,720
So actually, that did pretty well.

139
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,120
The only thing is we don't really

140
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,240
know what this chart is showing us.

141
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,240
We do know because we know the context that this

142
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,920
is the percentage of the letters' appearance

143
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,520
in the alphabet and also in the text that we're looking at.

144
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,360
And then these are the letters themselves.

145
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,520
So first letter is A, all the way to Z.

146
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,040
And you can see here that actually this maps pretty well.

147
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,640
So it's a good chance.

148
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,040
And in fact, we've seen this before.

149
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,160
So it's a good chance.

150
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,000
And in fact, we haven't looked at the book.

151
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,160
But it's a good chance that this book is in English

152
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,160
because these values match pretty well.

153
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,680
So let's go ahead and put together

154
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,480
some of the items that would make this chart

155
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,080
a little bit more readable.

156
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,200
And again, we have a video on how

157
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,200
to do this earlier in our series.

158
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,320
So if you want to go back and refer to that

159
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,040
as I move a little bit more quickly here, please do so.

160
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:32,520
All right, so let's pull the, let's

161
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,560
pull in a library that we want to use here.

162
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,680
So I'm going to go to Libraries.

163
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,280
And the library I want to do is I

164
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,400
want to do Structured Data here.

165
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,920
So the reason I typed in Set is because it

166
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,560
has this block Set Value.

167
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,520
And I want to be able to use that because it'll

168
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,160
make our work a lot easier.

169
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,680
So I'm going to pull that in.

170
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,480
And it's under Custom now.

171
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,600
And so you can see here that I can now start

172
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,760
setting values by key here.

173
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,560
Now, we'll need to make yet another variable here

174
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,800
called Chart Options.

175
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,440
And then what we'll do is we'll go back to Variables here.

176
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,520
And we're going to Set Chart Options.

177
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,320
Let's see, it's a lot of stuff going on now.

178
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,280
But I think probably we'll just do it right here,

179
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,560
just because that's where we're starting to work with the chart.

180
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,760
So we're going to Set Chart Options.

181
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,760
And here, let's get this out of the way,

182
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,640
we'll set it to our baseline options.

183
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,160
Now, we're going to adjust those.

184
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:39,840
But we need to pass in this new chart options here into Options.

185
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,520
And so our goal now is to make the adjustments we

186
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,320
need in between this Set block and the Switch to Costume block.

187
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,160
So first thing let's do is set a title.

188
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,240
And let's actually, I'm going to duplicate this.

189
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,760
Maybe the way to do this is I'm just

190
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,560
going to duplicate this block right here.

191
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,680
I'm going to bring it down, because that'll

192
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,200
help us to see what the options are that we want to work with

193
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,840
and how to describe their keys.

194
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,320
So you see Title is right here.

195
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,800
So we want to set the title.

196
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:10,600
And we'll say, just say Set Title of,

197
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:18,920
and then let's bring the Chart Options block here.

198
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,120
There we go.

199
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,360
So set the title of Chart Options to,

200
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:33,240
and then we'll just say, Book versus Language.

201
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,080
OK.

202
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,800
And then let's duplicate this again.

203
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,160
So maybe I should have kept this a little bit separate,

204
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,840
easier to duplicate.

205
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,920
Now I've got pieces that I don't want, but that's all right.

206
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,160
We can get rid of them.

207
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,660
And I'm going to duplicate it again,

208
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,440
because we're going to want to set the x and y-axes.

209
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,440
OK, so let's do that.

210
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,240
And again, here's this Chart Options

211
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,920
so we can sort of see how to call them.

212
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,420
All right.

213
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,920
So we've got the x label and the y label.

214
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:11,240
So the x label here is going to be Letter of Alphabet.

215
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:23,080
And then the y label is Percentage of Letter Frequency.

216
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,520
All right.

217
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,640
So let's drop that in here.

218
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,800
And now the only other thing we could do

219
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,880
is we could also put in individual labels

220
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,280
to indicate what language we're dealing with,

221
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,240
as well as what book we're looking at.

222
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,320
We don't have that information yet, but we could get it.

223
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,080
So for example, we could make another variable saying,

224
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,680
Book Title.

225
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,000
Let's just do that.

226
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,480
So Book Title.

227
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:05,040
OK, and then we might want to use this Language Name.

228
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,800
Or I mean, I guess we could just call it Language.

229
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,440
OK.

230
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,920
So now we've got Book Title and Language.

231
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,640
How do we actually assign them to things?

232
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,640
Well, Book Title, we'll drop in here.

233
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,960
And we're going to duplicate this call, Project Gutenberg

234
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,200
block, drop it in here.

235
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,520
But instead of Get Text, we're going to get Info about it.

236
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,020
And then we'll type in the same ID.

237
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,400
We should probably abstract the ID out

238
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,160
and make it something separate here.

239
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,360
So that's on our to-do list if we

240
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,080
want to make this a little bit fancier.

241
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,920
But let's just actually call out to this

242
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,640
just to see how this works.

243
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,800
So this gives us, we're working with Which Winnie.

244
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,960
And we actually need the title here.

245
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,400
There's a title and a short title.

246
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,720
But we'll just grab the title.

247
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,200
So that is Item 2.

248
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,320
And that's going to give us the title.

249
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,820
But it's also going to give us the key for the title, which

250
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,560
we don't want.

251
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,720
So we're going to want Item 2 of Item 2.

252
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:07,920
There we go.

253
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,360
Let's see how that works.

254
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,800
OK, Which Winnie, the Story of a King's Daughter.

255
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,840
I wonder if we do 3 if we get any.

256
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,520
Oops, this one needs to be 3.

257
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,520
That is better.

258
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,000
Oh, that gets the author.

259
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,880
OK.

260
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,800
Maybe that's a better way to do it.

261
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,080
OK, so let's do that.

262
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,280
So we don't want to set book.

263
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,840
This is the wrong variable.

264
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:33,360
We want to set, got this down.

265
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,640
OK, here we go.

266
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:38,000
Let's go to book title.

267
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,640
OK, so now we have the book title.

268
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,120
So now we need to get the name of the language

269
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,320
that we're going to be using.

270
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,120
And you remember, we did that up here

271
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,880
when we did all of it first.

272
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:53,080
So I think what we could do then is just do the opposite.

273
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,360
So we could duplicate this.

274
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,880
And let's make another block under here.

275
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,360
And let's just, it should be a variable here.

276
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,240
OK, let's set this instead of all but first,

277
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:14,000
we're going to set this to language title.

278
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,400
And this stays.

279
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:23,560
I can keep this stuff variable and easy to move around.

280
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,800
OK, so that stays.

281
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,840
But we just want item 1.

282
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,080
So in this case, we just want the head

283
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,400
because that will give us the title.

284
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,360
And that will give us the language.

285
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,040
Again, we should probably extract this information out

286
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,480
so we're grabbing the same language

287
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,720
so there won't be any confusion about that.

288
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,440
But now we set the language, and then we set the book title.

289
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,960
So we can go down here.

290
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,320
And let me just pull this down and see

291
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,000
if I can duplicate this block.

292
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,200
There we go.

293
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,640
And we'll reconnect these things.

294
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:58,000
OK, so now what we want to set are the labels up here.

295
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,440
Let's see that it requires a list, which is good

296
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,200
because it's a list that are the labels that

297
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,840
are what correspond to the two lists that we sent in

298
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,040
that is charted.

299
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,800
OK, so let's grab list here.

300
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,400
And the first one I passed in was the baseline.

301
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,800
So that's going to be the language.

302
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,720
Let's grab that right here.

303
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,520
So I'll make my way down.

304
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
There we go.

305
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
And then the other one that we want is the book title.

306
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
So let's add that down here.

307
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
All right.

308
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
So that's good.

309
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Now this just needs to be, I think,

310
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
what we say was labels, right?

311
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Labels.

312
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
OK, so let's get labels in.

313
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Now we're passing all this information in.

314
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Let's get this out of the way so we're not confused by it.

315
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
And if we've done it correctly, now we

316
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
should have a chart that actually shows

317
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
the language and the proper labels.

318
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
So we'll run it again.

319
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
It takes a moment, again, to reach out and grab

320
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
all the data, to do all the parsing that's involved,

321
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
and then to draw the chart.

322
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
The chart drawing probably is the fastest part

323
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
of this whole operation.

324
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
So we'll give it a second to work through all those steps.

325
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
And there we go.

326
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Now it's not totally perfect just

327
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
because our labels take up probably more space than we

328
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
want.

329
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
But you can see that we've got everything in the right place.

330
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
So percentage of letter frequency,

331
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
letter of the alphabet, book versus language.

332
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Compare English to this book, Which

333
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Lady by Elizabeth Champion.

334
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
And now you could change the language.

335
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
And let's do that here.

336
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
We'll try this one more time.

337
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Let's go over to changing the language.

338
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
And again, it would be good to extract this out

339
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
so we don't get confused about what language we're

340
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
dealing with here.

341
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
So it's these two here that we're dealing with.

342
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
This is setting it to English by item 2 and item 2.

343
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
This would be definitely something

344
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
that we'd want to refine.

345
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
But let's set it to 5, get a different language,

346
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
and we'll see how those letter frequencies hold up.

347
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Because the whole goal of this was

348
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
to see if we could find the baseline letter frequency

349
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
compared to actual frequencies of letters in a particular text

350
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
and then be able to tell whether that text was

351
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
written in a particular language or not

352
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
just by the patterns of letter usage alone.

353
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
So now that we're comparing it with a different baseline

354
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
from a different language, we would

355
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
expect to see that this graph looks somewhat different.

356
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
And the further the language is from English,

357
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
probably the more different this graph

358
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
would look because the patterns of letter usage

359
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
will differ more greatly.

360
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
All right, so now we compare it to Spanish.

361
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
And you can see here that, in fact, we

362
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
are seeing differences.

363
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
There are definitely some different spikes here.

364
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I mean, not totally different, not radically different,

365
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
but I think that you can see that it's not

366
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
quite as in sync as it was in terms

367
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
of the English comparison.

368
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
So we'll stop there.

369
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
But I would invite you to explore this further,

370
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
try out other languages in our list,

371
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
and see if you maybe, for example,

372
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
could find another book in Project Gutenberg that's

373
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
written in a different language and compared to English,

374
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
or maybe try to discover what language it was in.

375
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
So that's just a simple technique

376
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
to explore how you would do something that's not even

377
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
really advanced text analytics, but uses

378
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
the abilities that are built into NIST blocks

379
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
to grab information from a particular source, Project

380
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Gutenberg, to do some analysis of these patterns,

381
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
and then to use our charting service

382
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
to bring out their relationships.

383
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
So thank you very much for watching today,

384
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
and I look forward to seeing you in my next video.
