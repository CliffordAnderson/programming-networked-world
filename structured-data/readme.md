# Introduction to Working with Lists Using Keys

Welcome back to *Programming for a Network World*. Today, we will discuss how to work with long lists of lists by finding information using their *keys* instead of indexes. This method will make it easier to manage and retrieve information from your lists, especially when dealing with complex data sets.

First, we will use the *Structured Data Library* to import custom blocks related to structured data. These blocks will help us access and manipulate information in lists by their keys. We will experiment with a simple list containing key-value pairs, such as course and date. Using the built-in blocks will demonstrate how keys can make it easier to find the values we are looking for, as opposed to using traditional index methods.

To illustrate this method further, we will use an example from the real world that involves fetching data from the internet. We will search for items in the New York Public Library using a search term and receive a list of results containing various key-value pairs. With the help of the Structured Data Library and the *for each* block, we will iterate through the items and easily retrieve the titles without needing to worry about the index numbers.

## Key takeaways from this lesson
- Working with *keys* can make it easier to manage and retrieve information from lists, particularly when dealing with complex data sets.
- The *Structured Data Library* offers an efficient way to work with key-value pairs within lists by importing custom blocks.
- Using keys instead of index numbers simplifies the process of finding specific information in lists and improves readability for yourself and future users.
- Real-world examples, such as retrieving information from the New York Public Library, showcase the benefits of using keys in lists.
- The *for each* block combined with the Structured Data Library allows for easy and efficient looping through lists of key-value pairs.
