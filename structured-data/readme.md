# Working with Lists Using Keys

Welcome back! In this video, we will discuss how to work with long lists of lists by finding information using their *keys* instead of indexes. This method will make managing and retrieving information from your lists easier, especially when dealing with complex data sets.

First, we will use the *Structured Data Library* to import custom blocks related to structured data. These blocks will help us access and manipulate information in lists by their keys. We will experiment with a simple list containing key-value pairs, such as course and date. Using the built-in blocks will demonstrate how keys can make finding the values we are looking for easier, unlike traditional index methods.

To illustrate this method further, we will use an example from the real world that involves fetching data from the internet. We will search for New York Public Library items using a search term and receive a list of results containing various key-value pairs. With the help of the Structured Data Library and the *for each* block, we will iterate through the items and easily retrieve the titles without worrying about the index numbers.

## Key takeaways
- Working with *keys* can make managing and retrieving information from lists easier, particularly when dealing with complex data sets.
- The *Structured Data Library* efficiently works with key-value pairs within lists by importing custom blocks.
- Using keys instead of index numbers simplifies the process of finding specific information in lists and improves readability for yourself and future users.
- Real-world examples, such as retrieving information from the New York Public Library, showcase the benefits of using keys in lists.
- The *for each* block combined with the Structured Data Library allows for easy and efficient looping through lists of key-value pairs.
