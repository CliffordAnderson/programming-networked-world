# Introduction to Block-Based Programming with NetsBlocks

Hello everyone, my name is Cliff Anderson, and I'm a librarian at Vanderbilt University. In this series, we will explore the fundamentals of programming using a tool developed at Vanderbilt University called *NetsBlocks*. Unlike most common programming languages such as C, JavaScript, and Python, which are text-based, NetsBlocks is a *block-based programming language*. This approach aims to lower the barrier to entry and make it easier for newcomers to start programming without constantly having to look up commands or syntax.

Text-based programming languages can be challenging for beginners as it's easy to make errors, yet difficult to read and fix them. A common method for dealing with syntax errors involves searching online for solutions, likely leading to websites like Stack Overflow. In contrast, NetsBlocks utilizes a *palette of blocks* that represent units of computation. These blocks can be dragged and snapped together to build a program. If the blocks fit together, your program will generally work, albeit with occasional unexpected results.

During this course, we'll demonstrate how block-based programming can lead to complex ideas and concepts while maintaining a user-friendly and enjoyable programming environment. We'll start with a simple example of a "Hello World" program using our mascot, Alonzo, and gradually explore more in-depth applications. So stick around and let's see how far we and Alonzo can take you on this block-based programming journey.

**Key takeaways from this lesson:**
- NetsBlocks is a block-based programming language developed at Vanderbilt University aimed at making programming more accessible for beginners.
- Traditional text-based programming languages can be challenging for newcomers due to syntax errors and a steep learning curve.
- In NetsBlocks, users build programs by dragging and snapping together various computation blocks, akin to Lego bricks.
- Block-based programming can be used to explore complex ideas and concepts while maintaining a friendly, fun, and accessible environment.
- Throughout this course, we'll delve into numerous examples and applications of block-based programming with NetsBlocks.
