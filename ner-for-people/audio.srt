00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,720
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,840
Welcome back to Programming for a Networked World.

3
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,640
In today's session, we're going to continue

4
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,220
our exploration of natural language processing.

5
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,600
In particular, we're going to use

6
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,960
a technique called Named Entity Recognition, or NER.

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,640
We're going to use it to explore headlines in the news

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,520
and then pull out items of information

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,400
that we're interested in.

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,120
So ready to find people in the news?

11
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:25,920
Let's get started.

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,420
OK.

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,160
So for this project, we're going to use two RPCs.

14
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,240
And let me bring them out just so we can see what they are.

15
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,960
So the first RPC under Network here

16
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,280
is going to be where we get our news.

17
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,600
That's the New York Times here.

18
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,720
And you can see that it gives us options

19
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,960
to pull various pieces of information from the New York

20
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,460
Times.

21
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,080
We're going to go with Articles.

22
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,200
And let's go with the most popular.

23
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,520
And let's get the most viewed.

24
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,960
And that's going to give us a time period to choose from.

25
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,160
And let's pick for the week.

26
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,280
And so what happens when we click on this?

27
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,520
We get back a list of lists.

28
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,840
And we'll look at that later.

29
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,480
But it gives us basically the titles

30
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:14,800
that we're going to use to do some Named Entity Recognition.

31
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,760
The second is the Core NLP library here.

32
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:24,600
So this here should be under Language, Core NLP.

33
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,340
And here you see that it has what's called an annotator.

34
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,400
And you can annotate.

35
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,780
And then it says Get Annotators.

36
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,760
This will be a list of the annotators that we can use.

37
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,560
There's a whole bunch of things that we can explore here.

38
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,180
But today, we're going to be using the Named Entity

39
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,080
Recognition Annotator, NER.

40
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,880
So we'll go down and drop to Annotate.

41
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,240
And it asks us for a text and then the annotators.

42
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,920
Now, you notice that it's in plural.

43
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,680
So it actually wants you to give us a list of the annotators.

44
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,960
And let's just put this in list form

45
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,880
that we're only going to use that one.

46
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,040
And we're going to say NER.

47
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,800
So that should set us up for the RPCs that we're going to use.

48
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,200
Now, just to test this one to see what it looks like,

49
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:20,680
let's say this is Clifford Anderson's test.

50
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,720
OK, so we'll pass in some text.

51
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,520
We'll use this NER.

52
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:29,640
And then it's going to pass us back a sentence

53
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,680
with some value here.

54
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,800
Click into that.

55
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,760
And then we get three more lists here.

56
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,840
You can see the index 0.

57
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,900
There's entity mentions.

58
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,460
And then within entity mentions, there's

59
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:46,260
information about an entity that was mentioned.

60
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:50,140
And you can see here that this particular entity,

61
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:53,060
it identified Clifford Anderson as a person.

62
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:56,860
And it gives a confidence score here of 99%.

63
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:02,300
So we're 99% sure that I'm a person, which is a good thing.

64
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,980
So we'll use this technique of using the named entity

65
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:06,780
recognition.

66
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,220
But we're going to run it over the headlines that

67
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,820
are most popular in last week's news.

68
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:17,300
So in order to get this started, basically, this whole session

69
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,620
is just going to be working with lists.

70
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,500
And so we're going to be using our higher order functions that

71
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:30,860
work over lists, namely the map, keep, and I think

72
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,260
the other one, I always want to call it reduce.

73
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,460
But it's not called reduce.

74
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:39,260
It is called combine.

75
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:43,180
So we're going to be using those three, map, keep, combine,

76
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,980
in what follows to work with the lists that

77
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,420
come back from these RPCs and kind of drill down

78
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,580
to the results that we'd like to see.

79
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,060
OK, so let's get started.

80
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,860
And we'll use a bunch of variables throughout this.

81
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,300
So we might as well get that going here.

82
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,740
So let's go over here and just set up some script variables.

83
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,820
And the first one we'll just say is

84
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:09,140
going to be articles, say.

85
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,820
OK, so we'll get the articles.

86
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:15,980
And then we're going to set articles here

87
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,500
to the New York Times.

88
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:22,740
And so that part is pretty straightforward.

89
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,100
Now, the next thing we want to do

90
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,740
is when we get the articles back,

91
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,140
we want to be able to look and see what we got back.

92
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,620
Just the article, well, we always

93
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,540
need to have a control here.

94
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:38,300
We need to have the report block.

95
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,460
So let's report that.

96
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,540
Now, this is a little hard to read.

97
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:51,460
So let's just report for right now maybe the first row.

98
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,380
Take a look.

99
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,420
And here's the information that comes back.

100
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,660
Pull this over a little bit.

101
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,220
OK, so here's the title of the article.

102
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,140
This was Trump pulling a Putin amid the current crisis.

103
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,380
There's an abstract.

104
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,580
There's the byline section and everything like that.

105
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:23,780
So you can see here that what we want is the title.

106
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,280
Now, the easiest way to get the title

107
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,620
is to go back to our library.

108
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,900
And let's just open this here.

109
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,180
We want to import a library.

110
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,620
So let's go to Libraries.

111
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:36,020
And we want to use the Structured Data Library.

112
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,820
Here we go.

113
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,940
So pull that in.

114
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,580
And now under Custom, you can see that we've got value of.

115
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:48,140
So let's just substitute this item one of and say

116
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,020
value of title.

117
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,820
So probably need to, my guess is,

118
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,020
we're going to need to map this.

119
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:00,860
Let's try that.

120
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:04,440
All right.

121
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:08,820
Here we go.

122
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:09,820
Let's try that.

123
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:23,220
Now, let's see how that works for us.

124
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,060
There we go.

125
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,180
Now we have all the titles.

126
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:29,460
So the problem was we needed to go one step into the list

127
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:33,140
and then we went to map over each of the rows

128
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:36,380
in that long table and get the title out.

129
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,620
So now we've got the title.

130
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,500
But to pass this in, we could pass it

131
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,860
in as that 20 or so titles.

132
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,100
But it would be more efficient to actually combine

133
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,980
these titles together and then pass them all at once

134
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:53,100
into the RPC so we don't have to make 20 different calls out

135
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,260
to Core NLP.

136
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:58,060
So the way that we'll do that is we'll combine all these titles

137
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:58,580
into one.

138
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:05,140
Now, if we just combine them by joining this title like it is,

139
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,900
there won't be a space between the titles.

140
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,940
So we should probably put in a little space first

141
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,380
before we do that.

142
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,860
So let me just do that here.

143
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,220
I'm going to join.

144
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:20,460
And we'll just join a space at the end

145
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,420
just to separate out the last word from the first word

146
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,780
of the next title.

147
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,260
And I'm going to pull this in here.

148
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,980
And let's just take a look to see if this is working for us.

149
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:34,020
Should just put spaces in between.

150
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,100
So there's a space here at the end.

151
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,500
Now, how do we actually get this into a single list?

152
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,300
Well, there is that join here.

153
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,420
But this is meant for here's two strings.

154
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,420
How do you pass a list into this?

155
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,580
Well, here's a little trick.

156
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:50,260
So let's close up these spaces, these slots.

157
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,940
So it has no slots at all.

158
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,480
And I'm going to pull this map down.

159
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,020
I'm just going to drop it there where

160
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,580
there's no apparent slot.

161
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:00,460
And you see that it actually changes now to join input list.

162
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,860
So now it's going to join the strings that

163
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:07,700
come back from that map into a single string

164
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,100
without having to have a number of slots

165
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,600
open for each one of those strings.

166
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,620
It'll just assign those slots automatically

167
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,740
based on the length of the list.

168
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,780
So we click on that.

169
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,580
Now you can see, if you look at this,

170
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,940
it's kind of hard to see, that we've

171
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:25,620
got a set of titles, all one next to the other,

172
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,140
but with a space in between.

173
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,620
So that's what we wanted.

174
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,240
So now that we've got that information,

175
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,900
we're going to set that to, let's call it, title.

176
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:39,180
So I'm going to make another variable here,

177
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,380
call it titles.

178
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:45,820
Then we're going to set titles here.

179
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,420
That should be titles.

180
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,740
OK.

181
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:59,140
I'm going to set titles here to the call out to Core NLP.

182
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,300
OK, so we're on our way.

183
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:06,780
Now, let's just see what comes back when we report that.

184
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:12,780
Take a look again, sort of see where we want to go next.

185
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,860
OK, so we're calling this out.

186
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,700
But here's the thing.

187
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,340
Oh, OK.

188
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,060
Sorry, this should be what we set here.

189
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,500
Getting ahead of myself.

190
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,980
So we're going to do that now.

191
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,500
Let's call out to Core NLP and sort of see

192
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,300
what comes back when we send titles

193
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,740
into the annotation here.

194
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,300
So there we go.

195
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:35,860
Let's try that.

196
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:45,420
Again, we get sentences, and then we get this list of lists,

197
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:48,980
and then we get this entity mention.

198
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,500
So there's a lot of information coming back.

199
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,180
And we kind of want to drill down and be able to just

200
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,580
get to the results.

201
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,660
So how can we do that?

202
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:05,500
Well, first, we could go over here and under our custom,

203
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,500
let's use this value and just get the sentences here.

204
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,980
So that gives us one step in.

205
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:17,740
OK, now let's take a look at what comes back.

206
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:20,940
OK, that's good.

207
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:24,300
And here now we have the entity mentions.

208
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,860
And the entity mentions here has information

209
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,260
about the people that are mentioned.

210
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,420
So that's what we want.

211
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,780
We just need to be able to get to those.

212
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,660
So let's do that again.

213
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:39,660
But now we're going to need to map over this.

214
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,020
So I think this is maybe a good place for us

215
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,300
to maybe make another variable.

216
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:47,540
So let's just call this one Sentences.

217
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:52,820
So we don't get too complex as we go forward.

218
00:10:52,820 --> 00:11:00,020
And let's assign that to a variable here.

219
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,060
There we go.

220
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,460
OK, so now that we've captured it in sentences,

221
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:06,380
we want to drill down a little bit further.

222
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:09,540
And so let's do that again with another map.

223
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:13,240
So we'll report this information here just as we build this up.

224
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,300
And let's go over and get our map again.

225
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,460
Here.

226
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,220
And let's map.

227
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:29,260
And I believe that term was entity.

228
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:32,020
Well, let's take a look, because I don't remember offhand

229
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,140
what that term was.

230
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,740
So let's take a look.

231
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,620
OK, entity mentions.

232
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:41,460
So that's what we want to use here, entity mentions.

233
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:45,020
So let's see if we can get that out.

234
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:49,980
Entity mentions over sentences.

235
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,820
All right, try again.

236
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:01,220
OK, so now let's see what we've got here.

237
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,500
These are entities, in fact.

238
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:19,140
And there may be, you can see here, quite a few

239
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,180
and of different sorts.

240
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,140
They're not all people.

241
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:24,700
Some have to do with money.

242
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,980
And some have to do with number.

243
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,460
Some have to do with ideology.

244
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:32,900
So there's a lot that's here that we probably

245
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:36,100
don't want to have if we just want to look at the people.

246
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:41,380
OK, so what we could do then is filter this.

247
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,260
But in order to filter this, let's

248
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,820
make this list a little bit easier to read.

249
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,940
So we're going to call this, let's just

250
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,220
call these entities first.

251
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:57,180
All right, so we'll assign that value to entities.

252
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:04,740
And I think that one thing that we

253
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:08,060
could do to make this a little bit easier to read

254
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:11,780
is we could just take that list that's a little bit jagged

255
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,060
and make it a lot smoother.

256
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:16,260
And we can do that using a technique

257
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:22,540
that draws on combine and also on this append block.

258
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:27,340
So what we'll do is we're going to combine the values that

259
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:36,740
come back here from this map using this append block.

260
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:44,500
Now, what this will do is smooth out our list for us.

261
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,420
So now you can see that the list no longer is jagged.

262
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,340
It just has 34 entries here.

263
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,380
And only at the end, you see that you

264
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,580
get some extra information for some of these

265
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,460
that don't exist for others.

266
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,860
We'll ignore that for now, because what we're going to do

267
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:01,020
is the next step is we're going to filter or keep

268
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:04,100
certain items that match our criteria.

269
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,780
So let's do that next.

270
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:11,260
But first, let's assign this here to entities.

271
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:16,540
OK, so I want to set that block under variables.

272
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:19,260
Here we go.

273
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,100
And I'm going to set it to entities,

274
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,580
bring this over here.

275
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:26,260
OK, so our next step here is to filter.

276
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:30,140
And let's go over and grab that, which is

277
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,580
the keep block in nets blocks.

278
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,380
We're going to keep items that meet a certain condition.

279
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,940
And the condition that we want to meet

280
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:42,220
is that they have an NER value equal to person.

281
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:45,380
So as we saw, there was lots of other possibilities

282
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,300
for named entity recognition.

283
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:50,260
But in this particular case, we want to keep the persons.

284
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,820
So let's go ahead and do that.

285
00:14:52,820 --> 00:15:04,100
So we will grab from custom that the value here of the NER

286
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:15,700
in the list is going to be equal to person.

287
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:19,020
And the way that person is spelled here is in all caps.

288
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:25,860
And that's going to be from entities.

289
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,020
All right, let's see how that looks.

290
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,860
OK, now we've got a much smaller list.

291
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:41,500
And we should see, and I think it's going to be here in H,

292
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,900
that now these are all persons.

293
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:50,460
That whole row or column, H, is going to be just people.

294
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:53,060
So the last thing that we need to do to make this a little bit

295
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:58,100
easier to see is to take out the keys

296
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,740
and only look at the values.

297
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:04,700
This is a little bit tricky, but we'll show you how to do that.

298
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,180
So let's just put here, we're going

299
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,740
to call this one persons because that's what we're

300
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,020
dealing with at this point.

301
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,520
So we'll drop this down.

302
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:16,720
And we're going to set this, let's go here.

303
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,160
OK, we're going to set this variable to persons.

304
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,280
OK, here we go.

305
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,000
And we'll, oh, didn't drop down.

306
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,240
Persons, OK, not sure why that's not dropping down.

307
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,640
Let's try it again.

308
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:37,520
There we go, OK, set to persons, OK.

309
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,120
Now, to get rid of the keys, we just

310
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:47,640
need to map and get the, for each of the columns,

311
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,400
they all contain a list.

312
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,520
They have an item that shows the first item of the list

313
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,240
is the key, and the second is the value.

314
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,960
We just want to pull out the values.

315
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,880
We're going to need to map twice to do that.

316
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,560
So here's how we'll do this.

317
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,040
Going to take this map, and then we're

318
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:08,120
going to take another map, put it inside there.

319
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:11,680
Going to take this person's list.

320
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:19,560
We're going to map here item two of,

321
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:25,240
and this should map over every row, and then

322
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,760
every list in that row, or item in that row, which

323
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:34,760
is a key value pair, and just take the value portion.

324
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,520
Let's try that.

325
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,120
And there we go.

326
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,120
So now we can see the results.

327
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:51,720
If I can pull this down, we've got seven different people

328
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,840
that are mentioned.

329
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,400
You can see the names here, and you can also see here

330
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,360
the confidence scores.

331
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,760
This is other information about where those items are found

332
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,360
in the text.

333
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,440
If we wanted to see the keys, we actually got rid of the keys.

334
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,720
We'd have to go back and look.

335
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,840
But for now, we've got a nice table

336
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:11,160
that indicates who exactly we're looking for here,

337
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,640
or we've discovered in the news, and these

338
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,000
are the people that were most mentioned in the news

339
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,880
during the last week.

340
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,400
Now, if we want to look about Benjamin,

341
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,880
I think we'd have to do some investigation.

342
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:28,400
But otherwise, most of the names here are fairly recognizable.

343
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,280
So that's what we'll do today.

344
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,800
That's the end of our session today.

345
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,240
You can see how named entity recognition works.

346
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,920
You can also see that when you're

347
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,280
working with these complex lists,

348
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,840
you really have to master that ability

349
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,040
to apply the different higher order list

350
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,680
blocks that we've looked at.

351
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:51,440
So that's map, keep, and combine.

352
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,080
And by using them, you can process these lists really

353
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:59,200
efficiently and get to the results that you'd like to see.

354
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,920
So we'll continue with our exploration

355
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,440
of natural language processing again next week,

356
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,280
but that wraps it up for this segment.

357
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,360
Thank you very much, and see you in the next one.

358
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,000
Bye bye.
