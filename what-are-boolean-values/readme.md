# Introduction to Truth and Falsity in Programming

Welcome to today's lesson, where we'll be learning about *truth* and *falsity* in programming. We'll be working with *Boolean operators* to compute and combine true and false values. The goal of this lesson is to understand the basics of programming with true or false values using *Boolean logic*, which is crucial for making effective use of control blocks in your code.

We'll start with the simplest Boolean operator, the *not block*. Next, we'll move on to more complex Boolean expressions with binary operators, *and block* and *or block*. To better understand these operators, we will explore the concept of *truth tables*, which represent all possible combinations of input and output values for Boolean operators. This will help us see how and or blocks work in different scenarios and with different inputs.

Lastly, we will take a look at even more complex operators, like the *NAND* and *XOR* blocks, and learn how we can create them using simple operators. To make our learning more interactive and practical, we will solve a real-world problem, exploring whether 1 plus 1 equals 2 and if 1 is greater than 2, using various Boolean operators and comparison operations.

## Key takeaways from this lesson
- Basic building blocks of Boolean logic are *true* and *false* values.
- We can create complex Boolean expressions using operators such as *not*, *and*, and *or*.
- *Truth tables* help us better understand how Boolean operators work by representing all possible input-output combinations.
- More complex Boolean operators, like *NAND* and *XOR*, can be built using simple operators.
- Using Boolean operators, we can create more complex decisions in our code, and combining them with control blocks allows us to create branching logic.
