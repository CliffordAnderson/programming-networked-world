Welcome back to our class, Programming for a Networked World. In this session, we will explore using turtle graphics to draw intricate designs with NetsBlox. We won't be adding any new computational tools to our toolkit, but we'll be able to put them together in ways that create beautiful and interesting shapes. For inspiration, I have drawn my examples from a site called [Math Cats](http://www.mathcats.com/gallery/15wordcontest.html#peltonwheel) that showcases lots of beautiful and short Turtle Graphics programs in a language called Logo.

This video delves into the fascinating world of Turtle Graphics, a long-standing tool for introducing programming concepts in a graphical manner. We begin by exploring how to manipulate the color, hue, saturation, and brightness of the pen used in Turtle Graphics. We set up initial variables, and then we proceed to experiment with different shapes and categories. Adjusting the variables allows us to create various designs, from a sketch-like flower to a geometric star. We then move on to experiment with more offbeat combinations of variables, creating another flower-like design. 

We also discuss the option to hide the turtle that's drawing as it goes, which can create a more seamless animation effect. We continue playing with different combinations of variables, demonstrating how even small changes can drastically alter the resulting shape. The video also introduces the concept of Turbo Mode, which allows the program to skip from the start to the end result, making the drawing more or less instantaneous. This feature can be particularly useful when you want to quickly see the end result of your design without waiting for it to be drawn. 

Toward the end of the video, we experiment with changing the hue of the pen and adjusting the brightness levels. We create a unique geometric shape that resembles an organic form within a set of triangles. This serves as a reminder of Turtle Graphics's endless possibilities, encouraging viewers to experiment with different configurations, variables, and angles. 

In conclusion, this video demonstrates the versatility and potential of Turtle Graphics. We can create a wide array of interesting shapes and designs using loops and variables. This video serves as a testament to the fact that you can accomplish a lot with the knowledge you've gained in this course.
