Welcome back to our class, Programming for a Network World. Today, we will be exploring how to use turtle graphics to draw intricate designs with NetSplox. We won't be adding any new computational tools to our toolkit, but we'll be able to put them together in ways that create beautiful and interesting shapes. We will be saying goodbye to Ada and instead, we will be using our default turtle to draw these designs. The script we will be using will be a series of loops and we will also use a variable to control the size of our drawing and increase that variable as we go to make a sense of the drawing expanding. To start, we will set up the basic structure that we'll use to draw these figures on the stage. We will begin with a win green flag clicked block and then clear the screen. We will then control the turtle's orientation and its location on the stage by pointing in direction 90, 90 and going to 0, 0. This will set us up always being at the center of the stage pointing in the same direction. Next, we will start the drawing process by putting the pen down. We will bring in a series of loops to iterate through and draw things on the screen. We will use a repeat block and do this three times. Inside of this repeat block, we will put two other repeat blocks. We will then move and turn some degree. This is our basic structure. After setting up the basic structure, we will put the pin up at the end and test out where we are with this. Initially, it will draw a circle and go over the same track again and again. To improve upon this, we will create a variable called size. We will set it at the very beginning to be 0. We will use that size variable inside of the move block so the number of steps that we move will be controlled by the size. Finally, we will increment that variable by changing the size by 1. This will give us a spiral that goes right off the stage. Because we've just been changing the size of the steps, it spirals out instead of staying a circle. We can experiment with some of these values to draw different shapes. Top five learning outcomes from the video: - Understanding how to use turtle graphics to draw intricate designs with NetSplox. - Learning how to use a series of loops and a variable to control the size of the drawing. - Learning how to set up the basic structure for drawing figures on the stage. - Understanding how to use a repeat block to iterate through and draw things on the screen. - Learning how to increment a variable to change the size of the steps and create different shapes.In this video, we delve into the fascinating world of Turtle Graphics, a popular tool for introducing programming concepts. We begin by exploring how to manipulate the color, hue, saturation, and brightness of the pen used in Turtle Graphics. We set up initial variables and then proceed to experiment with different shapes and categories. By adjusting the variables, we can create a variety of designs, from a sketch-like flower to a geometric star. We then move on to experiment with more offbeat combinations of variables, creating another flower-like design. We also discuss the option to hide the turtle that's drawing as it goes, which can create a more seamless animation effect. We continue to experiment with different combinations of variables, demonstrating how even small changes can drastically alter the resulting shape. The video also introduces the concept of Turbo Mode, which allows the program to skip from the start to the end result, making the drawing more or less instantaneous. This feature can be particularly useful when you want to quickly see the end result of your design without waiting for it to be drawn. Towards the end of the video, we experiment with changing the hue of the pen and adjusting the brightness levels. We create a unique geometric shape that resembles an organic form within a set of triangles. This serves as a reminder of the endless possibilities that Turtle Graphics offers, encouraging viewers to experiment with different configurations, variables, and angles. In conclusion, this video demonstrates the versatility and potential of Turtle Graphics. By using loops and variables, we can create a wide array of interesting shapes and designs. This video serves as a testament to the fact that with the knowledge you've gained in this course, you can truly accomplish a lot.
