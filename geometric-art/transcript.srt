00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,840
Welcome back to Programming for a Network World.

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,920
Today, we're going to be exploring

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,760
how to use turtle graphics to draw really intricate designs

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,680
with NetSplox.

6
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,680
You won't be adding any new computational tools

7
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,740
to your toolkit, but you'll be able to put them together

8
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:20,960
in ways that really create beautiful and interesting

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,080
shapes.

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,480
So are you ready to bring out your inner artist?

11
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,240
Let's get started.

12
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:34,800
So as I say, today's goal is to draw some interesting shapes

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,480
using turtle graphics.

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,320
So to do that, we're going to have to say goodbye to Ada.

15
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,480
And let's do that right now.

16
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,560
I'm going to go to Costumes.

17
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,200
And we're just going to delete Ada.

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,240
And we get our default turtle back.

19
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,640
And now, we want to set up a script that will help

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,360
us to draw these designs.

21
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,800
This script will basically be a series of loops.

22
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,640
And we'll also use a script that will

23
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,120
And we'll also use a variable to control

24
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,800
the size of our drawing and increase that variable

25
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,920
as we go to make a sense of the drawing expanding.

26
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,640
OK, let's bring out our blocks now

27
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,440
to set up the basic structure that we'll use to draw

28
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,160
these figures on the stage.

29
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,080
All right, the first thing that we want to do

30
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,040
is let's just bring out a win green flag clicked block.

31
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,240
And then let's clear the screen.

32
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,440
So we're going to go to Pen.

33
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,600
And we're going to clear it.

34
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,520
So nothing will be there when we start.

35
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,320
And then I think what we'll do is

36
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,560
we'll point in the direction and go to 0, 0 just to control.

37
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,280
As you know, these are things that

38
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,320
control the turtle's orientation and its location on the stage.

39
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,600
So let's point in direction 90, 90.

40
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,400
And let's go to 0, 0.

41
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,960
OK, so that'll just kind of set us up

42
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,000
always being here at the center of the stage

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
pointing in the same direction.

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,360
So that's a good place to start.

45
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,120
We'll just kind of reset things as they are right now

46
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,080
whenever we start a new program.

47
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:05,160
And then I think we'll just move down to putting the pen down.

48
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,320
So now we're going to start the drawing process.

49
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,280
And here, we're going to bring in a series of loops

50
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,480
to iterate through and draw things on the screen.

51
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,920
So let's bring in a repeat block.

52
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,480
Let's do this three times, in fact.

53
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,600
So let's go over to Control.

54
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,080
And we're going to get this block that repeats.

55
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,840
And I'll put one right here.

56
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,680
And then inside of this repeat block,

57
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,720
let's put those two others.

58
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,000
So I'm going to put one right here.

59
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,120
Oops, if I can drag it out.

60
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,640
And then another right underneath it.

61
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,180
And then the thing that we want to do

62
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:50,280
is be able to move so that we'll draw something as we move.

63
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,520
And so we're going to do that.

64
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,520
We're going to move here.

65
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,600
I'll just take the default 10 steps.

66
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,840
And then we want to turn.

67
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,120
So we're going to turn some degree.

68
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,920
And this is kind of our basic structure here.

69
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,940
So let's just think about, OK, we've

70
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,800
got this set so that it will move, it will turn.

71
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:14,600
And let's do one more turn here at the end of this loop.

72
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,840
So once we get to the end of this loop,

73
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,760
these two inner loops will do something different right here.

74
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,860
All right, so now we've got this set up so that, in fact,

75
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,020
let's move this right here.

76
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,320
I think that might be better.

77
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,440
OK, so now that we've got this set up,

78
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,520
we want to put the pin up at the end.

79
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,680
And let's just test out where we are with this.

80
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,400
So ready?

81
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,240
So it's drawing a circle.

82
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:48,680
And it's kind of going over the same track again and again.

83
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,520
That's useful.

84
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,640
And it looks nice in its own way.

85
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,240
But I think we can improve upon it.

86
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,860
One thing that I'd like to do, if we look at what we have right

87
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,080
now, we don't have any variables here.

88
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,600
And that will allow us to do a bit of variation

89
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,040
in our drawing as we go.

90
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,600
So why don't we create a variable?

91
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,440
Let's call it size.

92
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,520
And I'll go over here to Variables, make a variable.

93
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,360
I'm going to call it size.

94
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,080
And I'm not going to show it on the stage.

95
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,360
There we go.

96
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,480
And let's use that size variable.

97
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,320
I'm going to set it at the very beginning.

98
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,800
Let's just set it to be 0 at the beginning.

99
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,720
But let's use that size variable.

100
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,000
Let's put it inside of the move block here.

101
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,200
So this one move block, let's just

102
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,640
move a certain number of steps.

103
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,300
And so the number of steps that we move

104
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,280
will be controlled by the size.

105
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,000
Right now it's 0.

106
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,640
So if we click on this, we won't end up drawing anything.

107
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,440
We're just going to be spinning around in a circle.

108
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,840
So we need to have some way to be

109
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,680
able to increment that variable.

110
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,960
So let's also move that change by block

111
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,400
that we've used before.

112
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,520
We're going to change the size by, let's say, 1.

113
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,120
And let's put this down here.

114
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,800
And so that's good, I think.

115
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,640
Let's try this out now and see if anything changes.

116
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,920
So now we get this kind of awesome spiral that's going.

117
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,000
And it's going to go, in fact, right off the stage.

118
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's a pretty big spiral.

119
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,960
But that's really cool.

120
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,380
Because we've just been changing the size of the steps,

121
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,140
it spirals out instead of staying a circle.

122
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,220
So you can see here now that we've got things set up

123
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,900
to look really nice.

124
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,620
We just have to experiment with some of these values

125
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,500
here to draw different shapes.

126
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,900
One other thing that we could do,

127
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,740
and I'll just kind of show you under the pen block.

128
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:29,660
It's kind of fun.

129
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,380
There are some other tools here to change, for example,

130
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,940
the color, the hue of the pen.

131
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,660
Or for example, you can drop this down.

132
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,120
You can see its saturation or its brightness.

133
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,660
And these will have different effects.

134
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,860
And so what I'll do, for example,

135
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,540
let's put this down here.

136
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:49,380
This is in our second loop.

137
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,340
And we'll change this by, let's just say,

138
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,980
1 each time we go through.

139
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,380
And then I want to just set up something

140
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,420
at the beginning that indicates what this color should

141
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,420
be when we start, just like we had everything

142
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,420
else for our initial variables.

143
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:06,940
So let's start by setting the pen here.

144
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:11,380
And we'll set its brightness to 0.

145
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:15,380
And that should allow us to slightly vary the drawings

146
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:19,100
that we make as we go along.

147
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:24,060
All right, so now let's start experimenting

148
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,740
with some different shapes and categories here.

149
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:32,660
Let's change this, for example, to 40, and then 3, and then 3.

150
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:38,140
And then maybe let's change this one down here to 60.

151
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,580
And let's see what this looks like.

152
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:45,980
So now you get a really cool kind

153
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:50,060
of sketch effect of a flower going out into infinity.

154
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:53,060
So I think that's really nice.

155
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:56,860
That's a really attractive design.

156
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,220
So let's try something else.

157
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,940
Let's experiment with another set of figures

158
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,620
here for our values.

159
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:07,820
And so let's try, this time, maybe 10, 9, 4.

160
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:12,340
And then for our angles, let's do 60 and 60.

161
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,340
And again, this is a more geometric design.

162
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:25,860
I mean, it looks like a star, but a really interesting star

163
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,180
with a center there.

164
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,540
That's an attractive design.

165
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,180
So let's keep experimenting.

166
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:35,500
All right, I think we might try something

167
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,540
a little bit more offbeat.

168
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,300
Let's try 13.

169
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,740
And let's think about this.

170
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:46,660
Maybe let's try 6, 6, 45, and 45.

171
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,420
All right, let's see what that looks like.

172
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:48,920
Ready?

173
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,220
So it's another flower-like design.

174
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,740
I think an interesting combination

175
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,660
of geometric figures that combine

176
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,460
to make this flower effect.

177
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,260
Now, one thing that I want to show you is,

178
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:06,220
you see here that we've got this turtle that's

179
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,780
drawing as it goes.

180
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,420
If you don't like that effect, you can actually turn that off.

181
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,020
And so let's go under Looks.

182
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:12,940
It's a hide block.

183
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,460
There it is, under Looks.

184
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:19,460
OK, so we're going to move that hide block into our stack.

185
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:23,100
And you'll see here now that if we do this again,

186
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,980
it just kind of grows without showing the turtle that's

187
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,380
actually doing the drawing.

188
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,660
And if you want to have a kind of animation effect,

189
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,420
that might be better than actually showing

190
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:34,420
the turtle doing the drawing.

191
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,340
OK, now let's try another combination.

192
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:40,180
Let's go for maybe, let's start up here.

193
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:43,540
And let's go for 40.

194
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:46,940
And then, I don't know, what do you think?

195
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:51,260
3, 3, 45, and maybe 90.

196
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:51,980
How about that?

197
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,180
OK, let's try this one.

198
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:00,860
So another star-like effect, but with some really interesting

199
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,860
inner patterns as well.

200
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:07,660
OK, once again, let's do something along these lines.

201
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:11,140
Let's just change this last one to 30, say.

202
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,220
Let's see how that differs.

203
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,020
And just by making that small change,

204
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:20,420
you see now that you have this kind of flower effect

205
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,820
rather than a star shape.

206
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,700
So it's amazing just changing some of these values

207
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,980
here what different shapes you get.

208
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,580
One last hint that I want to give you

209
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:31,460
is we've been seeing it draw as it goes along.

210
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,660
But there is a way to just kind of skip from the program

211
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,900
to the end result. And you can do that by going up here

212
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:42,140
and then clicking on Turbo Mode right here.

213
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:45,020
And so if you click on Turbo Mode and you click this now,

214
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,380
you won't even see any difference.

215
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,220
It just draws it on the stage.

216
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,140
So you don't have to wait for it to be drawn.

217
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,820
It speeds up the calculation so that actually the drawing

218
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,260
is more or less instantaneous.

219
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,020
And so let's try for our last one.

220
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,460
Let's just do something interesting here.

221
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:02,940
I'm going to actually change this down to hue.

222
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,980
And then we'll have to make sure we change this to hue as well.

223
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,100
And then let's change our value settings.

224
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,940
We'll stay with the numbers that we have here.

225
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,780
But let's go down and change this one to 90.

226
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,460
And this one should be 30.

227
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,180
OK, good.

228
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,660
All right.

229
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,700
And let's check this out.

230
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,180
And let's see, what have we gotten wrong here?

231
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:36,340
Oh, we forgot to set the pen back to brightness level 0.

232
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:39,140
Since we had it at maximum brightness,

233
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,060
we couldn't see the lines that were being drawn.

234
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:44,420
So now I'll set that back to brightness at 0.

235
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:47,340
And then I'm going to drop this down to hue.

236
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,860
And let's try this one.

237
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,220
So now you see that we've got this really interesting

238
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,420
geometric shape.

239
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,260
It's almost like an organic shape

240
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,460
within this set of triangles.

241
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,500
And so I would encourage you to experiment.

242
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,780
There are lots and lots of experiments

243
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:08,020
that have been inspired by Turtle Graphics and the Logo

244
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,140
programming language, as well as Scratch,

245
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:13,220
where people try all different types of configurations.

246
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,820
You could vary these loops.

247
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,220
You could add more variables.

248
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:21,140
You could introduce other angles at other times in this program

249
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:24,900
and produce really interesting geometric figures.

250
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,620
So I just wanted to show you in this video

251
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,380
that given what you've already learned in this course,

252
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,580
you can really actually do a lot.

253
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:34,900
And you can experiment with really interesting shapes

254
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:38,540
by using Turtle Graphics with loops and variables.

255
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,180
All right, so that sums it up for our first week.

256
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:45,100
I look forward to seeing you in our next video.
