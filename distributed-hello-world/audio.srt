00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,680
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,040
Welcome back to Programming for a Network World.

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,040
Today, we're going to begin our exploration of peer-to-peer

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,000
networking in Nest Blocks.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,960
In particular, we're going to learn to pass a message

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,960
from one Nest Blocks program to another.

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,620
So what we're going to be building today

8
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,840
is something called Distributed Hello World.

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,360
It's very traditional when you're

10
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,240
starting off in programming for the first time

11
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,680
to write a Hello World program, but we're

12
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,800
going to do it in a fun way.

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,360
I'm going to turn it over to Brian

14
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,600
to help us get started with some of the core concepts

15
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,920
we need to write this program in Nest Blocks.

16
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,320
All right, Brian, take it away.

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,240
All right, thank you, Cliff.

18
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,620
So as Cliff mentioned, we're going

19
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,440
to be writing a simple program where we have one application

20
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,720
running on a single computer that sends a message,

21
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,960
like Hello World, to another computer, which

22
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,080
then can display this message.

23
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,440
So I'm going to get started with this sender.

24
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,200
If we look under this Network tab or category

25
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,200
here in the palette, we can see that there's

26
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,640
this Send Message block.

27
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,880
So this will actually allow us to send a message

28
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,600
over the internet to another computer or a program running

29
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,400
on a different device.

30
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,440
So if we select this first dropdown,

31
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,360
there's this Message option, and this is the type of message

32
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,400
that we're sending.

33
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,520
So we're just using the built-in message type

34
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,680
provided by Nest Blocks, which has a single field, MSG.

35
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,080
Now, we can enter Hello World into this field.

36
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,560
Now, we just need to figure out who we

37
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,080
want to send this message to.

38
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,640
So Nest Blocks introduces this concept

39
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:41,120
of a room, which is composed of multiple roles, which

40
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,340
are basically individual subprojects

41
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:47,000
within this larger distributed application.

42
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,600
So in this case, we mentioned we wanted

43
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,360
to have one computer sending this message

44
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,480
to another computer.

45
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:58,320
So say this first computer is running this sender

46
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,520
application, which then sends the message

47
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,920
to this receiver application in this bigger distributed

48
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,160
program.

49
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:11,120
So we can rename our current role Sender,

50
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,040
and then this will correspond to that first application, which

51
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,000
just sends this Hello World message.

52
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,480
And then we can add another role, the Receiver role,

53
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,880
which corresponds to the application running

54
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,480
on a different computer that receives this message, namely

55
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,280
on Cliff's computer.

56
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,480
So I'll invite Cliff to this role.

57
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,520
OK, and so you see that Brian's message pops up on my screen,

58
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,600
and it invites me to join his program.

59
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,200
Now, one thing to note is when you say yes to this,

60
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,720
you're actually going to be leaving the program that you're

61
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,800
in and joining Brian's.

62
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,440
So what's on my screen now when I accept will disappear.

63
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,480
There we go, and you can see that Ada is gone.

64
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,520
And now I see that my program is called Receiver

65
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,960
at Distributed Hello World.

66
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,640
And that's because if you look in the room,

67
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,600
you see me down here.

68
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:11,480
I'm inside of the Receiver role at Brian's invitation.

69
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,400
Now, Brian has already created the block that

70
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,800
is going to send the message.

71
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,400
So I need to create a receiver on my side

72
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,320
under this Receiver role to be able to display

73
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,360
the message that he sends.

74
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,680
There is one trick that you have to keep in mind.

75
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,400
So let's just go ahead and start.

76
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,900
We'll go to Network, and I'm going to pull out this When I

77
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,240
Receive block here.

78
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,040
But then I get another pop-up saying,

79
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,160
edits cannot be made on projects by guests.

80
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,920
So this is just a little bit of insurance.

81
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,720
You can invite someone to join one of your projects

82
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,920
and take a role, but not be allowed

83
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,040
to actually edit the code.

84
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,020
So if we want to edit the code together,

85
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,560
then Brian has to give me permission.

86
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,600
So I'm going to request permission from Brian,

87
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,120
see if he accepts.

88
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,720
QUINN CLIFFE requests permissions,

89
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,680
and I see a dialogue pop up on my screen that

90
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,720
asks if I would like to actually make him a collaborator.

91
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,640
So in other words, elevate his permissions from someone

92
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,320
who cannot just play the game to someone

93
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,280
who can actually edit the application

94
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:10,320
or the underlying code of the Receiver role in this case.

95
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,200
So now that Brian has done that,

96
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,960
I can bring that block back over,

97
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,680
and you see that now it sticks in the coding area.

98
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,040
So all I have to do then is say, when I receive a message,

99
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,840
that's the name of the message, and then I

100
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,440
get the content of the message here.

101
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,080
And so we'll just need to have, oh, well,

102
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,200
we only have a turtle here.

103
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,960
Let's bring Ada back over.

104
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,920
Remember, we lost her in the transition.

105
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,180
So there is Ada.

106
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,740
And so we want Ada to respond now

107
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,020
when this message comes through.

108
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,740
So this is Steve Wozniak traveling back in time,

109
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,340
sending messages to Ada Lovelace,

110
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,180
but let's see if it works.

111
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:52,820
So I'm going to then say, and what do I say?

112
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,620
I don't say hello.

113
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,940
What I want to say is the content of that message that

114
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,420
came through for two seconds.

115
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,060
And that should be all that it takes.

116
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,540
So let's see if Brian sends that message,

117
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,460
whether I can receive it.

118
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,780
All right, so if I click this Send Message block,

119
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,700
we'll see that nothing shows up on Cliff's screen.

120
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,380
Because if we look back at our code,

121
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,220
we have this Send Message block, but we never

122
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,100
filled out who the recipient was going to be.

123
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,700
So if we select this dropdown, now we

124
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,420
can see Receiver, because Receiver

125
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,580
is the name of the other role in our room,

126
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,060
as well as a couple other options, like Others in Room

127
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,020
and Everyone in Room.

128
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,940
So we can now select Receiver.

129
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,180
And now when we click the block, we

130
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,380
can see that Ada says, hello, world.

131
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:39,740
So that's a really quick introduction to these concepts.

132
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,380
We're going to be building on them in future videos.

133
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,860
But now you understand the concept of a room,

134
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:48,140
roles within room, and how to send

135
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,740
messages between those roles.

136
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:54,340
So thanks, everybody, and we'll see you in our next video.
