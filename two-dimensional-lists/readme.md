# Introduction to Two-Dimensional Lists

Welcome back to our series on programming for a networked world. In this lesson, we are covering *two-dimensional lists*, which are also commonly known as lists of lists, matrix, table, or spreadsheet. Two-dimensional lists are an efficient way to keep track of data using columns and rows. Netsblocks optimizes the display of these lists, making them easier for you to read and edit. We will start by understanding two-dimensional lists and then explore their practical applications in a program.

A *two-dimensional list* is formed by putting a list inside another list. These lists of lists can be highly valuable in various scenarios, such as when you want to make a table of equivalent phrases in different languages. To create a two-dimensional list in NetsBlocks, simply create separate lists representing the different rows and then put them inside another list. This organizes the data well and even makes it look like a table.

To retrieve information from a two-dimensional list, you need to use the item function. First, select the list that you want and then subsequently the item within the list that you are looking to extract. For more deeply nested lists, the same process applies – continue to drill down to the list that you want until you can pull out the desired item.

## Key takeaways from this lesson

- Two-dimensional lists, or *list of lists*, are an efficient way of managing data in columns and rows.
- Two-dimensional lists can be used for various practical applications, such as internationalization of phrases.
- To create a two-dimensional list, place separate lists representing different rows inside another list.
- Information can be retrieved from two-dimensional lists by using the item function and drilling down to the desired list and item.
- Be mindful that working with lists of lists can be tricky, and it might take some practice to become comfortable with indexing and extracting information.
