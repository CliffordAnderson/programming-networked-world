00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
Hi, welcome back to Programming for a Network World.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,520
Today, we're going to be exploring

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,800
turtle graphics in NetsBlox.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,880
Turtle graphics provides a way to express

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,080
your creativity by drawing on

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,440
a coordinate plane on the stage in NetsBlox.

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,160
The ideas behind turtle graphics go back a long way to

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,640
the 1960s when a professor named Seymour Papert

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,260
invented a philosophy called constructionism that

10
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,340
challenged kids to learn by expressing

11
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,740
their creativity through drawing

12
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:36,460
simple graphics using computer programs.

13
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:40,460
We're going to be doing the same thing today and we'll explore

14
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:43,060
how turtle graphics allow

15
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:46,780
us to express our creativity within NetsBlox.

16
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:51,300
Ready to bring out your inner artist? Let's get started.

17
00:00:51,300 --> 00:01:00,220
Here's what we're going to do today.

18
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:03,460
We're going to draw just three simple shapes.

19
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,900
First, a triangle, and then a square, and then a circle.

20
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,300
But we're going to do it with some

21
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,700
increasingly sophisticated techniques.

22
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,940
But to begin with, let's just talk about what a turtle is.

23
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,840
If you look on the stage right now,

24
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,120
you'll see that Ada is here,

25
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,840
and Ada is actually behind the scenes, a turtle.

26
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,640
Now, you can have one or more turtles on your stage.

27
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,640
But in this case, we're just going to start with

28
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,080
the very simplest turtle representation.

29
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,580
If I go to costumes,

30
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,120
you'll see here that I get this option

31
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,400
to change back to this turtle shape,

32
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,920
this arrowhead-like shape.

33
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,560
I'm going to press that and we'll say goodbye to Ada.

34
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,320
You see here now that we have this turtle on our screen.

35
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,080
Now, the other thing to understand about turtles

36
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,160
is that they have two fundamental properties.

37
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,640
They're located in a particular space on a coordinate plane,

38
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,520
in this case, 0, 0,

39
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,480
right at the center of this Cartesian plane.

40
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,520
They also have a directionality.

41
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,280
In this case, it's pointing 90 degrees.

42
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,080
We have to be aware of both of

43
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,120
those properties when we're drawing figures.

44
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,640
Let's start by just drawing a triangle.

45
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,840
How would we do that?

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,560
Well, if we're drawing a triangle

47
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,240
and we're going to make 120 degrees for each of the angles,

48
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,600
we could do it this way.

49
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,160
We'll take 10 steps.

50
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,840
Let's change that to 50 just to make it a little bit bigger.

51
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,820
And then we're going to turn

52
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,520
and we're going to say 120 degrees.

53
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,120
And then let's move this over here

54
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,520
and we'll do the same thing again,

55
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:42,080
50 and we'll turn 120 degrees.

56
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,960
Then we'll do the same thing one more time,

57
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,960
50 and we're going to turn 120 degrees.

58
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,120
So that should make a nice triangle.

59
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,200
Let's try it out.

60
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,120
Nothing happened.

61
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,360
So why did nothing happen?

62
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,360
There's still one more important concept you need

63
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,640
in order to draw with turtle graphics.

64
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,360
And that is the idea of a pen.

65
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,000
So you see here that there's this pen tab

66
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,960
and you can bring over this two blocks,

67
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,280
pen down and pen up.

68
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,120
As they sound, the pen down will put a pen to the canvas,

69
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,800
so to speak, and allow you to draw with your movements.

70
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,960
And when you pull the pen up, the turtle will still move,

71
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,560
but it won't leave any trace behind.

72
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,720
So let's try that now.

73
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,280
We're going to put pen down and pen up

74
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,060
and we'll try the same thing.

75
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,920
And now you see that we have a nice triangle.

76
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,440
Now, one other thing is if we draw triangles like this,

77
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,560
we'll probably want to come back to the same spot.

78
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,760
In this case, we returned to the same spot,

79
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,200
but I think it's a good practice to get into

80
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,920
to always come back explicitly to the same part

81
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,400
of the coordinate plane and then point

82
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,640
in the same direction.

83
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,640
So here we're pointing 90 degrees

84
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,640
and we want to go to zero, zero, the center of our plane.

85
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,160
All right, and let's try that again.

86
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,000
And there we go.

87
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,280
You'll see that if we point in different directions,

88
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,760
here we can point, for example, to 270,

89
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,640
we'll draw a different triangle.

90
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,120
So we'll come back to the same place,

91
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,240
but we're pointing in a different direction.

92
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,720
Now, what do you notice about this stack of blocks?

93
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,160
One thing that you'll see is that there's

94
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,760
a lot of repetition here.

95
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,780
So there must be another way that we can make this easier

96
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,720
to draw shapes rather than just doing move, turn,

97
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,600
move, turn over and over again.

98
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,040
And we can do that using a control block called repeat.

99
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,640
And you see down here that there's this repeat block

100
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,680
and it allows us to specify how many times

101
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,680
we want to repeat something.

102
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,880
So if you want to draw a square,

103
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,800
we would draw lengths of 50, turn 90 degrees

104
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,800
and draw another length of 50 and so on and so forth

105
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,160
four times.

106
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,760
But rather than repeating this like we did for the triangle,

107
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,640
why don't we, let's just go over here

108
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,600
and duplicate some of this.

109
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,520
So we'll bring this over, we'll duplicate that

110
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,760
and put it on top here.

111
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:12,000
And then we'll also, well, we can just

112
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,080
pull this out ourselves.

113
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,360
Don't have to be too lazy about it.

114
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,640
So I'll go back over to motion and we're going to move

115
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,640
and we're going to turn.

116
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:29,640
So we'll move 50 and now we turn because it's a square, 90.

117
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,320
But how many times to repeat?

118
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,120
Four times.

119
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,360
So let's do that here.

120
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,560
And then we still need that pin up and pin down.

121
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,600
So let's do that.

122
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,400
We'll say pin down right before we start moving

123
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,640
and we'll say pin up right after we start moving.

124
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,880
And let's see if this is, in fact, a square.

125
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,600
It is.

126
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,000
And again, we can change our direction.

127
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,680
Here we're still pointing in 270.

128
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,880
We could change it back to 90.

129
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,560
You can actually just type this in too.

130
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,600
You don't have to click on it.

131
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,760
And there we go.

132
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,600
So now we've drawn a square and a triangle.

133
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,000
So let's try for something a little more difficult, namely

134
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,040
a circle.

135
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,000
Now, we're not going to get a perfect circle,

136
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,120
but we're going to do an approximation of a circle,

137
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,600
a polygon that has enough edges that it looks very smooth.

138
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,560
So how do we do that?

139
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,320
Well, we need to review a little bit of math.

140
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,440
We're going to start off by specifying the radius.

141
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,400
And let's say it's going to be 50.

142
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,200
So I'll make a variable for that.

143
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,040
Let's make a variable to capture that information.

144
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,880
We'll just call it radius.

145
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,080
Here we go.

146
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,800
And I'm going to set that radius to 50.

147
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,080
So I'll drop down here and put 50.

148
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,920
There we go, 50.

149
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,360
Now, how do we get the circumference?

150
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,640
Well, there's a formula for that.

151
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:52,520
2 times pi times the radius, 2 pi r.

152
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,800
And so we can calculate the circumference

153
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,560
using that formula.

154
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,440
So let's make a variable called circumference.

155
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,760
Circumference, if I spell that correctly.

156
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,160
There we go.

157
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,920
And drop that down.

158
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,760
And now we're going to get a math block

159
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,760
to be able to do that calculation.

160
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,000
And you see this little arrow?

161
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,800
We can pop that out so that we have three slots.

162
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:21,520
Now, the first slot that we need is going to be the 2.

163
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,200
And then we're going to need pi.

164
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:29,160
So we'll just make an approximation of this, 3.1459.

165
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,840
And then we're going to put in our radius, which we

166
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,760
have up here in our variable.

167
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,360
So that should get us a circumference.

168
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,560
And let's do the calculations here.

169
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,800
So we have a radius of 50 and a circumference of approximately

170
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,480
315, if you want to round it.

171
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:50,000
And now we need to get the segment length.

172
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,680
So the segments are going to be the number of the lines

173
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,280
that we draw in this polygon.

174
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,360
So let's create a variable, and we'll call it segments.

175
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,520
There we go.

176
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,840
And let's assign that over here.

177
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,240
Now, how are we going to set the segments?

178
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,320
Well, the segments, we're going to experiment

179
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,480
with what makes this polygon smooth enough

180
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,360
that it approximates a circle.

181
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,120
And so one way we'll do that, it was just

182
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,080
take the number of the circumference

183
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,200
and divide it by, say, 10, and then see what that looks like.

184
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,560
All right, so here we go.

185
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,240
We're going to take the circumference.

186
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,880
I can grab that from variables over here, drop it in,

187
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,840
divide it by 10.

188
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,520
And now, one thing that we want to do

189
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,520
is we want to actually make sure that this

190
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,560
is an integer, that is not a decimal.

191
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,240
Because if you look on this right now,

192
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,920
it's going to be 31.459.

193
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,960
We'd rather just go with a straightforward integer,

194
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,000
so a rounded number.

195
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,120
So there is a function over here.

196
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,800
Let's take a look at it.

197
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,600
It's under Operators, and it's called round.

198
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,000
And I think it's right there.

199
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,400
So we can pull this in, and we pull our calculation

200
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,600
inside of round and drop it back in.

201
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,280
Now, when we click on that, you see

202
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,120
we've got segments of 31 length.

203
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,840
That's great.

204
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,360
We just need a few more things here.

205
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,160
So let's take a look at what else we need.

206
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,920
Our segment length and our segment angle.

207
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,200
Now, the segment length, let's take a look at that.

208
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,840
The length, we've got 31 segments,

209
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,360
but how long should they be?

210
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,760
We'll calculate that by dividing the circumference

211
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,960
by the number of segments.

212
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:37,640
So let's go over here to set that and back to variables.

213
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,880
And let's make a variable.

214
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,760
And let's call it, let's say, segment length.

215
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,280
Segment length.

216
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:50,080
And then let's assign that here.

217
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,160
Set that segment length.

218
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,000
And we're going to set it, as I said,

219
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,720
to circumference divided by the number of segments.

220
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,960
So we'll need this operator over here for division.

221
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,560
We'll drop it in, and then we need to go back to our variables.

222
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,520
And we'll set it circumference divided

223
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,960
by the number of segments.

224
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,480
OK.

225
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,000
Very good.

226
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,200
And now we just need one more thing,

227
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,360
which is the segment angle.

228
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,640
So we need to make sure that this actually

229
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,680
turns into a approximate circle.

230
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,880
So let's work on that.

231
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,760
Let's get the segment angle.

232
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,680
And here we go.

233
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:34,600
So I'm going to go set another variable called segment angle.

234
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:40,440
And I'm going to set that here.

235
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,280
And we'll set the segment angle to 360

236
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:47,160
divided by the number of segments.

237
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:53,440
So we'll take our operator over here again, drop it there.

238
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,080
360 and the number of segments.

239
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,240
So we've got that already.

240
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,600
There.

241
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,680
OK.

242
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,720
That should be everything we need.

243
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,680
Now, we just need to add in the other information

244
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,400
that we had here.

245
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,600
So let's do the same thing.

246
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,640
We're just going to go.

247
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,640
We can just grab it again.

248
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,400
We want to go to 0, 0 like we've done before.

249
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,840
We want to point in direction 90 or whatever else direction.

250
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,440
And now we want to use a repeat block.

251
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,360
So let's go to Control.

252
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,580
And we'll go down to Repeat.

253
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,680
And how many times do we repeat?

254
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,880
Well, that's a good question.

255
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:35,040
We repeat the number of times that we have segments.

256
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,440
So let's go over here and grab segments.

257
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,880
So you can see that you can use a variable here,

258
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,600
just like we've created.

259
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,800
And you don't have to just type in a number.

260
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,840
OK, so we're going to repeat the number of times

261
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,760
that we have segments.

262
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,000
And what are we going to do for each of those times?

263
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,360
It's the same process as we had before.

264
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,880
So we're going to move.

265
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,560
And we're going to rotate.

266
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,480
Now, the question is, how much do we move

267
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,800
and how much do we rotate?

268
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,140
Well, you can see here with the information that we have,

269
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,000
we want to move the segment length.

270
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,640
And we want to rotate the segment angle.

271
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,000
So I'll go back to our variables.

272
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,840
And we're going to move the segment length.

273
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,800
And we're going to rotate the segment angle.

274
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,280
Here we go.

275
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,640
And the last thing that we need to remember

276
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:26,520
is to put our pen down and then bring our pen back up again.

277
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,360
So that's over here.

278
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,240
And let's see.

279
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,000
So we'll do it right here at the beginning.

280
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,440
And we'll do it again at the end.

281
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,360
So this should do it.

282
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,480
Ready?

283
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,960
Let's see.

284
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,480
There we go.

285
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,560
We got a circle.

286
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,480
Now, one fun thing that you can do,

287
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,720
and I'll just end with this little flourish,

288
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,480
is you don't have to always say what direction you want.

289
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,040
You can actually click on random here.

290
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,840
And so let's do that for these here.

291
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,920
So we're going to say direction for each of these

292
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,440
is going to be random.

293
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,640
And I'll do that same thing here.

294
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,240
Let's see.

295
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,520
Direction is going to be random.

296
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,640
Here we go.

297
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:12,600
And we can put on some hat block to make it easier to press.

298
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,240
So let's see.

299
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,480
For example, when some key is pressed.

300
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,640
So I guess to make a triangle, why don't we

301
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,720
associate this with a T?

302
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,400
And we can do the same thing here for our square.

303
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,960
Let's make that an S. And for the circle,

304
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:35,040
naturally, we will choose a C. Oops.

305
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,480
I brought out the wrong one.

306
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,680
Bring that back.

307
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,560
And this one is the one I want.

308
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,840
OK.

309
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,680
Now we're going to press a C for this.

310
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,920
And it will draw a circle starting at the same spot.

311
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,240
We've always said go back to 0, 0.

312
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,320
But it will appear in a different direction each time.

313
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,560
So let's try this.

314
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:58,400
So we can press T. And we can press S. And we can press C.

315
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,040
And each time we do that, we're going

316
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,200
to be in a different place.

317
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,680
And you can see you can also click on these.

318
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,320
And so you get some good random shapes.

319
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,240
And if you keep doing this, you'll

320
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,080
get some interesting designs.

321
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,360
All right.

322
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,640
So today, you've learned how to draw with turtle graphics

323
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:19,320
and also save steps by using these loops

324
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,280
so that you don't have to repeat those combination of blocks

325
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,120
over and over again.

326
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,400
I hope you'll experiment with some of the combinations

327
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,320
you have here.

328
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,960
And I look forward to seeing you in my next video.

329
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,720
Thank you.
