00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,520
Hi.

2
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,000
Welcome back to Programming for a Network World.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,560
Today, we're going to be talking about the broadcast block.

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,460
The broadcast block allows you to send messages

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,600
across projects and let those messages be picked up

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,680
by other sprites or blocks.

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,840
So when you think about broadcasting in daily life,

8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,680
if I want to broadcast something to the people around me,

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,280
I might shout, here, here.

10
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,800
And then they would look to me to see what I was talking about.

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,680
So in Nets blocks, broadcasts work in much the same way.

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,600
You can broadcast a message, and then other blocks

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,800
will pick up that message and be able to respond to it.

14
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,920
Ready to try out the broadcast block?

15
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,720
Let's get started.

16
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,080
OK, so to get going, we're going to set up

17
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:58,160
a very simple exercise of just sending a broadcast message

18
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,120
and then receiving that broadcast.

19
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,320
But we're going to do it across two sprites.

20
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,680
So the way we'll begin is we'll set up a message

21
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,400
that Ada will send out.

22
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,320
And if I go over here to the Control palette

23
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,560
and I bring over Broadcast, you see, oh, there we go.

24
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,760
Let's bring over Broadcast.

25
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,360
It has a dropdown.

26
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,080
And I can drop it down, and I can say New.

27
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,020
And it's going to ask me for a message name.

28
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,780
The message name is basically a bare symbol.

29
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,420
It's anything that you want to give it.

30
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,820
And that's what the receiver of the broadcast

31
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,300
will get when the message is sent out.

32
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,900
So it doesn't have any content beyond its name.

33
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,340
That's why I call it a symbol.

34
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,900
So I will just say Broadcast Hello.

35
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,620
And let's put that.

36
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:46,220
And you'll see that I've got now my Hello message.

37
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,780
And so let's just put When Space is Clicked to get it

38
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,580
a little bit more interesting.

39
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,260
Now, if I just click this right now,

40
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:56,940
you'll see that it activates, but nothing happens.

41
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,820
And that's simply because we've broadcast this message,

42
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,420
but there's no corresponding receiver

43
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,260
to pick up that message.

44
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:09,700
So let's bring in another sprite to pick up our message.

45
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:13,740
I'm going to go over here, and I'm going to create.

46
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,260
Let's see.

47
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,500
We've got to go over here to create a sprite first.

48
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,380
And there it is.

49
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,660
Let's give it a costume.

50
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:24,060
So I'm going to go over to Costumes.

51
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,180
Always takes a while to open up Costumes.

52
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,220
And there's Alonzo.

53
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,940
And we'll bring up Alonzo on the stage a little bit.

54
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:38,120
Now, we want Alonzo to receive that message

55
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,580
and then do something in response.

56
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:44,740
So now we're working inside of Alonzo's script area.

57
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,380
And there is a corresponding block

58
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,980
called When I Receive.

59
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,380
So this hat block can have a dropdown here

60
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,780
that shows it can respond to any message.

61
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,060
So anytime anything happens that's broadcast,

62
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,140
it can respond to it.

63
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,740
Or it can respond to particular types of broadcast messages.

64
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:06,060
In this case, we're going to use the Hello message.

65
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,740
And so when Alonzo receives the broadcast from Ada,

66
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,460
then Alonzo will respond with whatever

67
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,420
we put under this hat block.

68
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:20,380
And in this case, why don't we go to a Say block.

69
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:26,300
And we'll say, hello to you too.

70
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,780
OK.

71
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,300
So now we have a very simple program.

72
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,500
We'll start it off with Ada.

73
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,940
And we'll press the Space key.

74
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,260
And voila, you see.

75
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,620
We'll try it again.

76
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,340
There it is.

77
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,500
Hello to you too.

78
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,540
So Ada broadcast this message hello.

79
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:49,860
And then inside of our Alonzo script,

80
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:55,820
we see when I receive hello, say hello to you too.

81
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:59,220
Now, the way that you use broadcast very often in programs

82
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,540
is to coordinate events that are taking place.

83
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:05,540
It's very often used, for example, in games.

84
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,860
So when you're working with a game, for example,

85
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,980
you might want to set a condition in which

86
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,260
if two sprites collide with each other,

87
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,180
then the game is over.

88
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,500
And you broadcast to everything else in the game

89
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,140
this game over event.

90
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,780
So that's a very common way of setting this up.

91
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,740
And we can try that ourselves here.

92
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:28,140
So let's move our scripts off.

93
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:31,340
And we're going to start again afresh.

94
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,820
Here we go.

95
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,460
And we will set up.

96
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:38,500
Let's do a little change of our characters.

97
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,740
We'll say goodbye to Ada.

98
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:45,580
And we'll change Alonzo's costume

99
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,860
into a rocket ship, how about?

100
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:52,900
So let's go down to costumes again.

101
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,580
And let's take a look.

102
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,860
There's a rocket ship here somewhere.

103
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,820
There's a robot.

104
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,540
That's not too bad.

105
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,060
We could go for that if we can't find the rocket.

106
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,980
Ah, spaceship.

107
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,660
We did get it.

108
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,780
So let's bring that in.

109
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,860
There's a spaceship.

110
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:25,540
Now, and we want to remove this costume.

111
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,020
So we've got a spaceship.

112
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:31,060
And let's set up some more sprites, or at least one more.

113
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,720
So we'll create a new one.

114
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,820
And let's give this one a costume

115
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,860
that we create ourselves.

116
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,100
So we'll go over here to paint.

117
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:43,980
And I'm going to just take this circle like this.

118
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:49,020
And then maybe we'll color it a little bit differently.

119
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,300
Here we go.

120
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,260
OK.

121
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,820
Now, this is going to be a very simple game.

122
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,580
And you're going to have to expand on this

123
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,740
to make it interesting.

124
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,980
But what we'll do for this sprite, which

125
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:10,340
we'll call rock or asteroid or something like that,

126
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:13,020
we'll have this come down from the top of the screen.

127
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,300
And then the rocket will need to avoid it.

128
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,420
And if the rocket collides with it,

129
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,260
then we're going to broadcast the game over event.

130
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,020
OK.

131
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,180
So we're going to take this asteroid.

132
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,440
And we're going to go to a scripting area.

133
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:31,960
And when we start the game, when the green flag is clicked,

134
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,560
we want to move it to the very top of the screen

135
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,760
and hide it off screen.

136
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,280
All right.

137
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,280
So let's do that.

138
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,520
Hide here.

139
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,200
We're going to find under Looks.

140
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,640
There we go.

141
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,840
We're going to hide it.

142
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,800
We're going to go to, let's say, coordinate x is 0.

143
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,680
And this will be negative 200.

144
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,760
Let's just try that out.

145
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,840
And there we go.

146
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,920
OK, so it's off the screen.

147
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:08,080
Let's have it go down and see if it can collide with our rocket.

148
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,820
OK.

149
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:15,360
So we'll take the next thing we want to do is, OK,

150
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,760
we're going to have it glide to a particular direction.

151
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,800
And we're going to have that direction be chosen at random.

152
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,480
So we need to go to Operators and look at Random.

153
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,680
Pick Random here.

154
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,520
OK.

155
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,960
So we'll have it glide.

156
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,560
And let's set our initial time of five seconds.

157
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:41,760
And then let's have it glide to someplace

158
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:46,600
on the bottom of the screen, 150, let's say, 200.

159
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,480
OK.

160
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,480
And between this and this, let's just try it out

161
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,120
and see how it works.

162
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,360
And we need to show it, too.

163
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,520
OK, so let's try this.

164
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,440
Let's see how that works.

165
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,720
Oh, we've got it coming from the wrong direction, which

166
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,640
could be a challenge.

167
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,160
So let's switch these.

168
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,440
So this will be 200.

169
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,480
And then we'll try negative 200.

170
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,240
Let's try that.

171
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,320
OK.

172
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,800
So we've got our asteroid coming down.

173
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,800
And it's not going down quite far enough.

174
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,960
We want it to be off screen.

175
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,280
So let's go to negative 250.

176
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,680
And now we just want to put this into some kind of loop,

177
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,960
right, so that we have new asteroids coming down

178
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,320
every time.

179
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,760
And we need to make sure that they change a little bit more

180
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,520
in their direction.

181
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:44,640
So let's do 150, negative 150 to 150.

182
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,920
Let's see if that works better.

183
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,120
This should make our asteroid do a little bit more

184
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:57,200
interesting paths at random, going in different directions.

185
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,200
It makes the game a little bit more interesting.

186
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,640
There we go.

187
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,480
And we'll make it a little bit faster.

188
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,280
OK.

189
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,880
So let's put this into a loop.

190
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,240
And we're going to do, let's do a forever block.

191
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,960
So that's down here.

192
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,000
And there we go.

193
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,320
OK, let's just test this out.

194
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,920
It should just keep going.

195
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,360
So we get down to the bottom.

196
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,720
And it goes up to the top again.

197
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,280
And it's going to be picking different directions.

198
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:29,800
OK.

199
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,680
So we got that piece going.

200
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,800
And now we need to give some controls to the rocket.

201
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,480
So let's get over to the rocket.

202
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,040
And here, with the rocket, we basically

203
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,640
want to respond to the event of moving left and right.

204
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,640
We basically want to respond to the event of moving

205
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,240
left and right.

206
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:50,400
So when the key is pressed, in this case,

207
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,480
let's just assign this to the left arrow.

208
00:09:53,480 --> 00:10:06,480
Then we want to move, let's see, we'll say, change x here.

209
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,400
That's probably the easiest block to use.

210
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,800
So that's our x-coordinate.

211
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,440
And we're going to change it by negative 5.

212
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,520
Let's just test that out.

213
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,320
So it's moving to the left.

214
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,200
And now if we want to move it to the right,

215
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,800
we can duplicate this, drop this down here,

216
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,000
and put it to the right.

217
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,320
There we go.

218
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,640
OK, so now we've got controls here.

219
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,160
I've got to change this to 5, because otherwise we're

220
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,200
just moving the same direction.

221
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,280
So now we've got controls.

222
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,640
We can move our rocket back and forth.

223
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,640
So in a way, we're ready to play our game, right?

224
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,440
So if we start this with the green flag,

225
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,800
I can move and try to avoid this.

226
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,400
Oh, not so good.

227
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,600
Let me try that again.

228
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,880
Got to move faster.

229
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,160
There we go.

230
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,280
Get back to the center.

231
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,640
Whoa.

232
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,960
OK, so we can play our game.

233
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,680
But you notice there's one problem here.

234
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,520
I mean, to make this a full-fledged game,

235
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,680
there's probably lots of things that we want to add.

236
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,600
But there's one very significant problem,

237
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,600
namely, when this asteroid comes into proximity

238
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,120
with the rocket, nothing happens.

239
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,360
So we need to detect that event.

240
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,960
And then we need to broadcast this game over event

241
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,520
to show that the game has, in fact,

242
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:23,480
ended when the two objects collide.

243
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,320
So to do that, let's go over to here.

244
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,160
We're back again inside of our rocket sprite.

245
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,640
And we're going to do a sensing block.

246
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:37,640
And we've got this touching.

247
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:41,280
So we can drop down, and we can say when.

248
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,280
So this is just detecting that it's touching.

249
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,640
So it's not touching right now.

250
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,320
That's false.

251
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,920
But if we click on it again when they are touching, it's true.

252
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:57,760
OK, so we'll do another event here under Control.

253
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:05,280
And this will be when touching.

254
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:11,240
So when that occurs, we're going to broadcast game over.

255
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,400
So now, let's go back and get a broadcast block.

256
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,320
So we're going to broadcast here.

257
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,800
And we're going to make a new message.

258
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,200
We're going to call it game over.

259
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:23,680
Here we go.

260
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:29,760
So now, you'll see, when they're touching,

261
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,240
it will broadcast game over.

262
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,920
But we haven't set anything up on the receiver side yet.

263
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,000
So in this case, if we're running this,

264
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,120
the message is broadcast as soon as the asteroid

265
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,360
touches the rocket.

266
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,360
But nothing stops because we haven't set up

267
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,240
the receiver on the side.

268
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,280
So we need to set up the receiver here.

269
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,160
And let's just do that.

270
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:58,480
When I receive over here, game over.

271
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,880
Now, we just want to do something

272
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,360
that's going to stop that.

273
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:08,120
So you'll see that down here, there is a stop all.

274
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:13,120
And so that will stop the sprite from doing its forever loop.

275
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,800
And so in this case, when the two objects collide,

276
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,480
then it should broadcast game over.

277
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,040
And the other sprite should receive that message.

278
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,720
And stop all.

279
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,160
OK, let's try it.

280
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:27,800
So here we go.

281
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,320
I'm avoiding.

282
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:28,880
I'm avoiding.

283
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,480
Oh, I didn't avoid it well enough.

284
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,760
The game is over.

285
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,600
Let's try it again.

286
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,400
Oh, oh.

287
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,360
All right, let's try it one more time.

288
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,680
Here we go.

289
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,560
I just cannot avoid it.

290
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,640
I really want to try to avoid this.

291
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,560
OK, I avoided one successfully.

292
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,120
That's good.

293
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,240
Avoiding another, just barely.

294
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,320
And oh, oh.

295
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,160
It collided.

296
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,880
So you see now that these two sprites

297
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,400
are communicating to each other by broadcasting

298
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,800
these symbols that are picked up.

299
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,900
And then you can respond to those messages that

300
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,120
are broadcast appropriately.

301
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,280
All right, that's it for this time.

302
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,360
We're going to be diving into more complex messages

303
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,840
next time that Nets Blocks enables.

304
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,040
And we'll see you in our next video.

305
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,760
Thank you.
