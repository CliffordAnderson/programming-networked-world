00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,200
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,600
Welcome back to Programming for a Networked World.

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,280
In today's episode, we're going to be continuing

4
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,200
our exploration of mapping.

5
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,920
But today, we're going to see how

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,800
we can make a map more dynamic.

7
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,120
We want to be able to scroll around on the map

8
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,840
and see what exists over the map's horizon, so to speak.

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,600
So ready to explore the world by scrolling through maps?

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,400
Let's get started.

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,520
OK, so we'll begin today, just like we

12
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,480
have in other ones of these particular series,

13
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,160
by bringing out a map and displaying it on the stage.

14
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:44,960
So here, I'm going to go over to get our block for the map

15
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,760
and go down to Google Maps.

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,920
And then we get to Google Maps.

17
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,560
Here we go.

18
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,080
Let's see.

19
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:59,960
We're going to Git Map.

20
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,120
There we go.

21
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,840
OK, and we've got latitude, longitude, width, and zoom.

22
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,800
We'll fill all that in.

23
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,880
But we want to start with our latitude and longitude.

24
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,320
So we want to actually look up where we are.

25
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,480
So let's go back over here to Network.

26
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,680
And let's pull out the call block here.

27
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,240
And let's get the geolocation, RPC.

28
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,120
And we're going to geolocate.

29
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,520
And we'll geolocate our address.

30
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,840
Let's just say Nashville.

31
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,160
OK, and we'll call this.

32
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,200
And we'll get our latitude and longitude.

33
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,640
Now, let's create some variables for that.

34
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,400
So we're going to be using this here.

35
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,120
So let's go to our Variable tab.

36
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,720
And we're going to make a variable.

37
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,200
And let's just call it one latitude.

38
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,560
How about just lat?

39
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,000
That's easier.

40
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,240
Lat.

41
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,880
And then we'll create one for longitude.

42
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,160
So we'll make a variable for lon, like that.

43
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:12,480
And then we're going to make a variable for the zoom.

44
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,920
OK, so we've got those three things

45
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,840
that we need here to fill in the various slots in Google Maps.

46
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,400
So let's assign them.

47
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,800
So we'll start by assigning a longitude.

48
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,920
And that's going to be here.

49
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,720
We need to use the item of block.

50
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,560
And we need to get to item 2 of item 1, I think.

51
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,320
Let's try that.

52
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,000
Let's try that.

53
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So here we go.

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,680
We'll pull this down.

55
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,880
Oops.

56
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,680
Pull it down here and click on it.

57
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,200
And 36, I think that's going to be right.

58
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,080
That's the latitude.

59
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,160
OK, there we go.

60
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,120
So that one we should set to latitude.

61
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,320
And then let's do the same thing here.

62
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:10,400
But we'll duplicate this block and put it here.

63
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,840
And we're going to switch this to the longitude.

64
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,920
And now let's do item 2.

65
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,360
And let's see if we can set that.

66
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,960
So we have our lat and our longitude set.

67
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,360
And zoom we'll set later.

68
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,360
We don't need to display these on the stage.

69
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,680
So we're going to unclick those boxes there.

70
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,000
But we know we have that information captured.

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,680
And then we want to be able to put this into our map.

72
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,280
So let's go ahead and get the size of the stage

73
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,320
like we normally do from sensing.

74
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:45,280
So we'll go over here to get stage height, stage width.

75
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,200
Stage height, stage width.

76
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:59,080
And now we'll use our variables to fill in the rest.

77
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:04,520
So latitude here, longitude here.

78
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:10,920
And let's set an initial zoom of, let's say, 10.

79
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,160
OK.

80
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,920
So what we want to do is we want to set those variables up

81
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,760
when we first start our program.

82
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,640
And then we want to pass them into something

83
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,680
that will create the map for us.

84
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,920
So what we're going to do is we'll use a hat block here

85
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,920
to say, when clicked, we're going

86
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:34,000
to go to set these variables from our geolocation.

87
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,600
And we could make this a little bit more dynamic

88
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,900
by actually allowing people to choose what city they're in.

89
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,700
Maybe we ought to go ahead and do that.

90
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:48,100
So we can go to Looks, or actually to Sensing,

91
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:55,180
I guess, right here, and ask what city.

92
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:04,780
Or how about select a city or enter a city.

93
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,740
How about that?

94
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:07,420
And wait.

95
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:10,540
And then we can use the answer here instead of just natural.

96
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,620
So that'll help us to start a little bit more dynamically.

97
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:18,060
And now, we'll start it that way.

98
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,180
But then we need to call this particular block.

99
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:23,220
So here, we're going to actually use an event.

100
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:28,380
So we'll go over to our operators here.

101
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,940
And actually, I think it's under Control.

102
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:31,700
OK, Broadcast.

103
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,620
That's what we want.

104
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,180
OK.

105
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,700
So we're going to broadcast an event.

106
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,540
And let's just drop this down here.

107
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,180
And we're going to say New.

108
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:49,500
And we'll say, how about Show Map?

109
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,180
OK.

110
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,500
So we'll say Show Map.

111
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,340
And then we're going to handle that event.

112
00:05:53,340 --> 00:06:01,020
So when I receive a Show Map, then we're

113
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,740
going to display on the stage.

114
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,300
We're going to switch to the costume of this particular map.

115
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,220
And we'll put it in this block here.

116
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,420
And we'll show that map.

117
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,180
Now, this ought to work at this point.

118
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,780
So let's try that.

119
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,980
We're going to click on this.

120
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:18,020
And we're going to say Nashville, like that.

121
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:22,540
And then, if any luck, it should show us the map.

122
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,060
Let's see.

123
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,180
Did we miss something here?

124
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,900
I think we didn't plug in our variables.

125
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,420
No, we do.

126
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,420
We have lat and long.

127
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,220
We just need to have zoom.

128
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:30,860
Let's see here.

129
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,780
Let's pull that over under Variables.

130
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:37,260
OK, so we'll get zoom here.

131
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,900
OK, so it should show it.

132
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,460
Let's just see if that works again.

133
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,740
All right, so pick a city.

134
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,100
We'll say, this time, Boston.

135
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,820
OK, yeah, it's working.

136
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,400
OK, so we didn't have zoom in before.

137
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,020
So it didn't know how to zoom in.

138
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,380
So we didn't see the map.

139
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,940
OK, now the thing is, we need to make it more dynamic.

140
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,620
We want to be able to actually move up.

141
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,580
Right now, if I use my scroll keys or arrow keys,

142
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,540
I can't move the map.

143
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:07,260
It's just a map that is what it is.

144
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,460
There's no way to zoom in.

145
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:13,700
There's no way to move up or down, explore the area.

146
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,380
So we want to make our map more dynamic.

147
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:19,060
All right, how would we go about doing that?

148
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,780
Well, the thing that we need to do

149
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,700
is just change slightly where our location is.

150
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,260
So we know that we have that location already here captured

151
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,460
in latitude and longitude.

152
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:33,060
So it would be simple, I think, to just say, OK,

153
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,300
let's just change that.

154
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:38,140
So we could, in response to a particular keystroke,

155
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:42,860
let's say an up arrow, we could add some code to handle that.

156
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:46,860
So let's go over here to say, when I'm

157
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,460
going to see if I get some space down here.

158
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,940
An up arrow is clicked.

159
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:59,620
Then we want to move up.

160
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,540
But how do we move up?

161
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:03,020
Well, we add to our latitude.

162
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:09,500
Oh, actually, this should be longitude, right?

163
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:09,980
Let's see.

164
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,940
So 42, let's see what's going on.

165
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,620
All right, so let's try this.

166
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:20,260
So we're going to take our lat, and we're going to add to it.

167
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,740
All right, so here we go.

168
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,300
All right, and so we're going to add.

169
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,340
But what do we add to it?

170
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,300
Well, let's just try adding one to it.

171
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,460
And then we'll call the map again.

172
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,900
All right, so here we go.

173
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,620
Let's do that.

174
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,620
When we do that, we just need to broadcast the map.

175
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,860
I guess we'll pull that down again here.

176
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,140
So let's go over to Broadcast, and we'll

177
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:50,100
broadcast that we need to recreate that map, the show

178
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:50,860
map.

179
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:53,060
OK, so that's in place now.

180
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,940
And so let's try the up arrow.

181
00:08:54,940 --> 00:09:00,540
If we do that, you can see that we are definitely moving,

182
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,260
and we're moving up.

183
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:06,060
But we're moving up in a kind of,

184
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,340
it's hard to know how much we're moving at a time,

185
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,980
but more than we probably want.

186
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,540
It's actually hard to keep track of where we are.

187
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,060
So let's try this again.

188
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,580
I'm going to go back to Boston.

189
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,420
And you can see that one movement up

190
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,580
moves us way north.

191
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,100
So we can't just move up by one.

192
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,900
That's a little bit of an arbitrary number.

193
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,220
And the thing is, it also depends

194
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,260
on how far zoomed in you are.

195
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:36,620
Adding one to our latitude, when it's really zoomed in,

196
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,580
moves us a long way.

197
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,740
But when we're zoomed out, may not move us much at all.

198
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:44,060
So we actually need to know the relative amount we

199
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,540
want to move at our level of zoom.

200
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:51,220
We can do that with a technique of finding the max latitude

201
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:54,740
and the min latitude at a particular level of zoom

202
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:58,180
on the map, and then taking the difference between those

203
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,860
and using that as the degree to which,

204
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,340
or the number that we're going to use to move up and down.

205
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,380
So let's figure out how to do that.

206
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,780
So here, I'm going to write a little routine

207
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,300
to find that information.

208
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,980
You'll see that under the Network tab

209
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,060
here, we can call Cloud Variables again.

210
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:22,820
And if we drop down to the maps, we'll

211
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:28,780
see here that we have min latitude and max latitude.

212
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:29,700
Let's start with that.

213
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,500
So we're going to get max latitude.

214
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,860
Service is not available, but fortunately it is.

215
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,460
And we'll duplicate that.

216
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:41,780
And we're going to get the min latitude.

217
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,620
So that's going to be the latitude

218
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:51,180
at the top and the bottom of our map that's in view right now.

219
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:54,580
And so then we can take the difference between them.

220
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,660
And so I'll just pull this over here.

221
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:02,340
And we'll put the min latitude here and the max latitude

222
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,440
there.

223
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,900
And we'll get a difference between the top and the bottom.

224
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,660
Let me see if I can just pull this whole block over.

225
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,460
Here we go.

226
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,500
And so if I click on this block, you'll

227
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,220
see here that it's 0.359.

228
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,380
So that's showing us, OK, if you want

229
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,240
to move a full page view up, that

230
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,400
would be the amount that we would need to do.

231
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,160
But we actually don't want to move probably even that much.

232
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,280
We probably just want to move a quarter

233
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,520
of the screen at a time.

234
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,080
That gives us the sense of continuity

235
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,800
as we're kind of moving through.

236
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,600
So let me just drop this into here, if I can grab it.

237
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,920
There we go.

238
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,600
Get it in the right slot.

239
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,280
There we go.

240
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,880
I need more space over here.

241
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,480
So let's do that.

242
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,800
And I'm going to put in four into this slot,

243
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,800
if I can move it in the right place.

244
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,600
There we go.

245
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,760
So I'm going to put four right here.

246
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,200
And you can see now that we get this number that's

247
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,760
fairly small, but that will give us

248
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:01,800
a much more effective sense of scrolling through the map.

249
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,320
So now that we've got that, that's

250
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,840
what we want to use to figure out every time when

251
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,560
we need to set a variable to capture that information.

252
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,440
And then that will help us to know how much we need to move.

253
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,640
So when we regenerate the map with a zoom level,

254
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,640
we should probably also capture this information.

255
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,120
So what I'll do is I will create a variable up here.

256
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,400
Let's enter variables.

257
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:30,800
And I'm going to call it, let's see.

258
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,320
Let's see, I'll make a variable.

259
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,160
And let's just call it scroll amount.

260
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,440
And let's set that variable.

261
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,880
And we're going to put this down here,

262
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:49,800
scroll amount to this number.

263
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:55,920
OK, now let's try that again.

264
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,080
Let's bring our map back so we can see it here.

265
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,440
And I'm going to turn scroll amount off.

266
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,880
We'll just hit the green flag, get back to,

267
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,000
let's try Nashville again.

268
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,080
OK, so we're in Nashville.

269
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,240
Now let me try the up arrow.

270
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,400
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

271
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,000
I think the reason it's not working

272
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,200
is we haven't put the variable in the right place.

273
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,280
So let's do that here.

274
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,680
We're going to put scroll amount in here.

275
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,200
And now let's start again.

276
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,440
There we go.

277
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,760
All right, ready?

278
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:35,040
Now you can see the continuity of the screen

279
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,680
as we go into Kentucky.

280
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,680
So in order to get this to work as a full feature scrolling

281
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,240
map, we just need to replace this.

282
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,520
Let's see if we can do this here pretty quickly.

283
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,760
We need to handle all four events.

284
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,080
We need to do an up arrow.

285
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,960
Whoa, not sure what happened to that one.

286
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,920
OK, let's try that again.

287
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,960
So let's do this.

288
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,280
We're going to duplicate it.

289
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:04,240
Oops, just got part of it here, but we'll duplicate the rest.

290
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,160
There we go.

291
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,560
And then let's duplicate it again.

292
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,480
There we go, put it there.

293
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,920
Our scripting area is getting kind of crowded.

294
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:20,760
OK, so let's do up arrow and then down arrow.

295
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,960
Down arrow, of course, we want this,

296
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,160
but we want this to be subtracted.

297
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,880
So let's go over here and get that.

298
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,600
There we go.

299
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,000
So we want that to be subtracted.

300
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,200
And so that's the lat and the scroll amount.

301
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,120
There we go.

302
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,640
OK, and now let's do the same thing again here.

303
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:53,440
So we've got up, down, and now we need left.

304
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,160
And this one, of course, will be longitude.

305
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,800
So let's get that from variables over here.

306
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,840
So there's longitude.

307
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,000
Now, you might ask, do we need to capture

308
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,160
that information for the max longitude and the min

309
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,800
longitude in the same way that we did the max latitude

310
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:18,280
or the max, yeah, the max latitude and the min latitude?

311
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,880
The thing is, actually, those numbers

312
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,760
are basically the same.

313
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,240
So in this case, since our map is square,

314
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,040
we don't really need to worry about that.

315
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,640
We can just use those same numbers and it should be fine.

316
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,560
So we're going to just stay with the scroll amount that we have.

317
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,400
And then the only thing that we need to do here

318
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,640
is to also change this.

319
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,840
And I'll just kind of duplicate this one up here.

320
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,560
There we go.

321
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,520
Oh, no, let's get that back.

322
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,840
OK, let's duplicate it, bring it down here.

323
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:51,240
Then we'll switch this one out, grab the longitude,

324
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,000
subtract, and throw this in here.

325
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,360
OK, so we should be handling all of the events now.

326
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,160
So let's see how that works.

327
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,400
So we'll start again.

328
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,280
Let's try Houston.

329
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,360
OK, so we're in Houston.

330
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,960
Let's go up.

331
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,920
Oh, OK, that did not work as I expected.

332
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,720
So let's see what we did wrong here.

333
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,560
OK, one other thing that we didn't change, you see?

334
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,320
Simple bug here.

335
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:32,160
So the up arrow is setting the lat to lat plus scroll amount.

336
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,440
The down arrow, we need to change these

337
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,960
to the longitude and the longitude.

338
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,920
OK, so that's good.

339
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,320
Although, I don't see why that's affecting that.

340
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,480
Let's try it again here.

341
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,760
OK, Houston.

342
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:52,280
OK, I think we've got it working now.

343
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:52,880
Let's try it.

344
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,600
So we should be able to move around.

345
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:01,440
And there we go.

346
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,320
Now, there's one that's not working.

347
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,880
Let's see.

348
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,920
Just double check here.

349
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,640
So down arrow, left arrow, up arrow.

350
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,120
Oh, we've got up arrow in there twice.

351
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,360
Actually, I think that was the cause of the bug.

352
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,280
So now we want to go right arrow this direction.

353
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,560
Let's see if we've got that.

354
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,280
And we may actually have these backwards.

355
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:26,360
Let's try right arrow and left arrow.

356
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,040
There we go.

357
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,200
OK.

358
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,080
All right, here we go.

359
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,560
Bring this map over.

360
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:48,920
OK, up, down, left, right, up again, down again.

361
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,320
OK, so you see now that we have a scrolling

362
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,240
map, which is fantastic.

363
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,280
There's only one thing left that we have to do.

364
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,320
We have to be able to change our level of zoom.

365
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:04,600
So let's pick another when something key is pressed block.

366
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,920
And in this case, we're going to pick the plus.

367
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,600
And that will increase our zoom level.

368
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,360
And then we'll do the same thing,

369
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,400
but we'll do it in reverse when we get the negative.

370
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,840
So I'll just duplicate this here.

371
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,280
This is going to be roughly parallel code.

372
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,440
And we'll change that to a negative.

373
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,320
OK, so we just need to adjust our level of zoom.

374
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,600
So we came in with that default level of 10.

375
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,600
So here, we'll set.

376
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,960
And so when this plus key is pressed,

377
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:43,160
we're going to set the zoom to one level higher.

378
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,920
So let's go to get our variable zoom.

379
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,920
Here we go.

380
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:51,640
And we'll just say zoom plus 1.

381
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,480
And same thing happens, but in the other direction.

382
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,720
So we'll just duplicate this here, put this here.

383
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,280
And we'll set the zoom.

384
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,280
But in this case, we're going to go the other direction.

385
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,760
So let's pick it as minus.

386
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,520
And we'll put this in here.

387
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,760
And we'll subtract 1.

388
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,480
OK, so here we go.

389
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,280
OK, let's try.

390
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,120
Stop it, and we'll just run it again.

391
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:24,960
OK, San Francisco.

392
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,040
There we go.

393
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:30,280
Now, let's try zooming in.

394
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,280
I'm not getting a response right here.

395
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:32,840
Let's see.

396
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,760
We just click on this.

397
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,480
Oh, well, there's a reason.

398
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,080
You see, we've got the plus sign here.

399
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,000
But the last thing we need to do is use this broadcast.

400
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,240
So let's do that.

401
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,240
We'll bring this down here.

402
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,120
And we're going to do the same thing here.

403
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,040
Let's duplicate that.

404
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,000
There we go.

405
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,840
Because we have to obviously pass it back to the map

406
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,960
so that it can actually reset the level of zoom.

407
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,520
OK, and then in the map itself, we've

408
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,360
got the zoom where we expect it to be right there.

409
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,480
OK, so now let's try zooming out.

410
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,720
Let's see, there we go.

411
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,160
Whoops, that's zooming in.

412
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,080
No, it's zooming out.

413
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,240
OK, perfect.

414
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:17,880
There we go.

415
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,360
And we want to zoom back in.

416
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,400
There we go.

417
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,800
Now, the trick is, at the level of zoom that we have,

418
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,560
will our arrows work correctly?

419
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,440
And they do.

420
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,860
We're still getting the difference

421
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:34,920
between the max longitude and the min longitude

422
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,960
for the level of zoom we have in the map, which

423
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,160
means that we're scrolling at the right level.

424
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,640
So in the end, I want to thank kittyhacker101

425
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,480
for the idea of how to develop a scrolling map.

426
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,980
Although my technique is a little bit different than

427
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,660
that person's technique, I appreciate the inspiration.

428
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:56,420
So OK, in our next video, we'll sum up our work on mapping.

429
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:59,180
And look forward to seeing you then.
