00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hi everyone, welcome back to Programming for a Networked World.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Today's topic is Boolean logic.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We'll be exploring a logic that the mathematician George Boole invented in the 19th century,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and it's fundamentally simple at its core.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It's about ways of combining true and false, zero and one, on or off.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Boolean logic is at the heart of how computers operate,

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and it's also used almost everywhere in computer science.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So today we'll just begin by exploring the simple operators you can use to combine Boolean values.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Okay, ready or not, here we go.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Okay, let's get started by just seeing where to find Booleans in nets blocks.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So if you go to operators here, this green tab, you'll see that we've got several options here that have pointy ends.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Those are the Boolean operators.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So let's just draw the first one onto the stage, and you see here it's true.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Now these are reporters, and so that means that they will report their value.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And in this case, if you click on it, it will report the value true.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And if you hit this slider, you can see that you can also make this true into a false.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And if you click on that in the right spot, it will report false.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Okay, so far so good.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Now with Booleans, the trick is that there are operators to allow you to combine them to model complex logic.

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So let's start with a simple one here, which is AND.

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:57,000
AND allows you to put two Boolean values together and then make a decision based on the values of the Boolean operators on both sides.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So let's put in, for example, one here, and then we'll put another one right here.

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And we'll switch that like this.

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Okay, so AND, if both sides are true, will report true.

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And you see that it does.

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
But if one side is false, then it's going to report false.

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And that's true even if both are false, it's going to also report false.

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
OR is the opposite, in some ways, of AND.

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And we'll put these together here.

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Now when you have OR, like that, and you click on this, it's going to be true.

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:44,000
But if one side is also false, it's still going to report true as long as one side or the other is true.

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So that's true, and you can see if we switch this like that, and click on that, it's also true.

33
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Okay, the only time that OR is going to be false is when both sides are listed as false, and in that case it's going to report false.

34
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Now, one way of visualizing how these Boolean operators work is by using something called truth tables.

35
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
And so I've created a netsbox project that does have these modelist truth tables.

36
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Let me just open that now.

37
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Here we go.

38
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Boolean operators.

39
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Okay, as you can see, this project looks more complicated.

40
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's using lists, which we're going to come to later in this course.

41
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,000
But for the purpose of this exercise, all I want to show you is how you can combine these Boolean values to create a truth table.

42
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So let's explore that.

43
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:49,000
We've seen the AND block, and we know that if a true is on the left and a true is on the right, then it's going to report true.

44
00:03:49,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But what the truth table tells us is all the possible combinations of left and right, and what they result in, what is going to be reported.

45
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So here, if we click on this list, we see three columns, the A, B, and C.

46
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Now, the way to interpret this is the A column is the Boolean value that you're passing in on the left.

47
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The B column is the Boolean value that you're passing in on the right.

48
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And the C column is the result.

49
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So you can see that now we look at all the possible combinations of AND, and we see if you have a true and a true, it will report true.

50
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Otherwise, any other combination is going to report false.

51
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And the same thing down here with the OR.

52
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
If I click on this, we see the truth table for OR.

53
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And what I see is every combination is going to be true, except for the case in which both sides, the left and the right, have false.

54
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And in that case, the OR is going to report false.

55
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So this is the inverse of AND.

56
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Now, you can also create Boolean operators that don't exist in the next box palette.

57
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
We'll get into how to do that later in this course.

58
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:18,000
But I thought I would show you just one other example of a very common Boolean operator called XOR or exclusive OR.

59
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The idea here is that OR actually in everyday language has a bit of an ambiguity.

60
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
If I say to you, would you like tea or coffee?

61
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You don't interpret that as meaning you can have tea and you can have coffee or you can have both.

62
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
What you usually interpret that to mean is you need to pick one or the other.

63
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So that's an exclusive OR.

64
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And if you look at the truth table here, you'll see that the truth table models that situation.

65
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So in this case, we're not going to ask for both coffee or tea and expect to get both.

66
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
That would be false.

67
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
We're going to ask for one or the other.

68
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So either coffee or tea will report true.

69
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
But not if you ask for neither.

70
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Then you will get nothing.

71
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Or if you ask for both, then the waiter will politely bring you nothing in this scenario.

72
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
So the XOR is also used quite commonly in computer programming.

73
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And we'll come across it later.

74
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:30,000
But the point is that the base Boolean operators that are provided in the nets blocks palette can be used to make even more intricate Boolean operators that you may want to create yourself for whatever programming exercise you're undertaking.

75
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Okay, so that's the basic introduction to Boolean operators.

76
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
As you've seen, Boolean operators are very simple.

77
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
They're always about true or false.

78
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:44,000
But these operators allow you to combine them in very intricate ways to model complex situations.

79
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
We'll be seeing them a lot more in this course.

80
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So you'll have plenty of opportunity to become familiar with them.

81
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
But for today, we'll stop there.

82
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And I look forward to seeing you in my next episode.
