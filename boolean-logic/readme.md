# Boolean Logic

Welcome back to our course, Programming for a Networked World. Today, we will delve into the fascinating world of Boolean logic, a concept invented by mathematician George Boole in the 19th century. 

This logic, which revolves around the combination of true and false, zero and one, or on and off, is the foundation of how computers operate and is widely used in computer science. We will begin by exploring the simple operators used to combine Boolean values. We will start by identifying where to find Booleans in NetsBlox.

Under the operators tab, you will find several options with pointy ends, which are the Boolean operators. These operators are reporters, meaning they report their value. For instance, if you click on the operator, it will report the value true. However, you can also change this value to false. 

The beauty of Booleans lies in the operators that allow you to combine them to model complex logic. We will start with the AND operator, which allows you to combine two Boolean values and make a decision based on the values of the Boolean operators on both sides. If both sides are true, AND will report true. However, if one side is false, it will report false. This is also true if both sides are false. The OR operator, on the other hand, is somewhat the opposite of AND. It will report true as long as one side or the other is true. The only time OR will be false is when both sides are listed as false. 

To visualize how these Boolean operators work, we will use something called truth tables. These tables show all the possible combinations of left and right, and what they result in. For instance, with the AND operator, if you have a true on the left and a true on the right, it will report true. Any other combination will report false. The OR operator, however, will report true for every combination, except for the case in which both sides are false. Lastly, we will explore the XOR or exclusive OR operator, a common Boolean operator not found in the NetsBlox palette. XOR is used to model situations where you need to pick one or the other, not both. For instance, if you ask for coffee or tea, you expect to get one or the other, not both. XOR models this situation. 

The base Boolean operators provided in the NetsBlox palette can be used to create even more intricate Boolean operators for your programming exercises.
