00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,080
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,560
Welcome back to Programming for a Network World.

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,240
Today, we're going to continue our exploration

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,200
of remote procedure calls, or RPCs.

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,840
In this episode, we're going to be looking at data and ways

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,240
to visualize data.

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,960
It's very common, for example, when you access a data set

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,520
that you want to get a visual representation of it.

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,120
And fortunately, there's an RPC for that in Nest Blocks.

10
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,080
So ready to visualize some data?

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:28,760
Let's get going.

12
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:35,360
All right.

13
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,000
So to begin, let's get the data itself.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,960
So the data set that we're going to be using

15
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,160
is a data set collected at the Manaloa Observatory in Hawaii.

16
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,040
This data set tracks the level of carbon dioxide

17
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,440
in the atmosphere.

18
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,080
And the reason that Manaloa is so useful

19
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,080
is that it's on an extinct mountaintop,

20
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,440
and the levels of carbon monoxide

21
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,720
are really unaffected by the environment around it,

22
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,720
which allows you to get kind of an average for the atmosphere

23
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,000
as a whole.

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So we have an RPC that reaches out and gets

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,960
that historical data, and then brings it back to us

26
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,560
in list form in Nest Blocks.

27
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,280
So let's start there.

28
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,520
We're going to go over to the Network tab here,

29
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,480
and we're going to go to our call block.

30
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,520
And we're going to drop down this call block,

31
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,800
and we're going to go here to Climate.

32
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,120
And then under Climate, you'll see Manaloa carbon dioxide

33
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,080
data.

34
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,680
And as you see here, we can get either the trend

35
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,840
or the raw CO2.

36
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,480
We're going to go with the trend.

37
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,080
And I believe the start year is 1958,

38
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,360
so we'll put that in as the beginning year.

39
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,760
And then the last year that's available to us in Nest Blocks

40
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,800
is 2019.

41
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,400
So we'll use that as our delimiters,

42
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,840
and then we can call this.

43
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,880
And you see that it provides a nice table form of the data

44
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:07,920
with the year, and the month, and then the recorded level.

45
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,680
OK, so that's great, but it's not easy necessarily

46
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,400
by just looking at this to see what the trend actually

47
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,840
looks like.

48
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,040
So in order to do that, we're going

49
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,800
to use the GNU plot charting service.

50
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,880
This is a free and open source library for plotting data,

51
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,360
and it's available to us again in Nest Blocks.

52
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,200
So if I bring this over here and I drop down to Chart,

53
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,120
you'll see that it brings me a block that has two options.

54
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,200
One is to draw, and the other is default options.

55
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,760
So we can just use it with the default options

56
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,920
and then call with our own data set

57
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,380
and just see how it looks at first.

58
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,500
So I'll bring this in here to Lines.

59
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,000
And then for the options, you still

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,820
need to pass something in or do.

61
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,140
Maybe it works without it.

62
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,300
I think it actually worked without it.

63
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:01,960
So there you go.

64
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,900
If you don't need to change the options,

65
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,100
you can just let it go.

66
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,260
So let's look at this.

67
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,560
In this particular chart, you see

68
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,820
that it's actually too small to look at.

69
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,340
How do we visualize this better?

70
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,860
Well, we do that trick of going up to Looks

71
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,140
and using Switch to Costume.

72
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,580
So Switch to Costume will change the costume

73
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,780
of the sprite on the stage, in this case,

74
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:29,300
from Ada to the chart itself.

75
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,180
So we can drop that in.

76
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,260
Here we go.

77
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,480
And we can make that call.

78
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,540
And there you can see that already we

79
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,060
got a nice plot of the data.

80
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,780
And unfortunately, as it shows, from 1958 until 2020,

81
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,460
we've increased our carbon dioxide level

82
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,340
in the atmosphere substantially.

83
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,820
Can't do much about that in this particular video.

84
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,980
But we can at least, I think, maybe

85
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,220
label what we're seeing a little bit better.

86
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:00,060
So to do that, we need to dive back into those options.

87
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,740
So I'm going to bring over another block here.

88
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,180
And we're going to call out to chart.

89
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:05,940
Oops.

90
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,900
See if I can actually bring it over this time.

91
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,340
There we go.

92
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,500
I'm going to go to chart.

93
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,340
But this time, I'm going to look at the default options.

94
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,820
And if I click on that, you see that it brings me back

95
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,900
another list here in table form.

96
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,020
And it has some possibilities for us

97
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:24,580
to fill in information, like we can give a title.

98
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,580
And we could perhaps add something

99
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,620
to the y label or the y-axis.

100
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,580
But how do we do that?

101
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,040
We can't just type it in here and have it stick.

102
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,620
We need to first assign this default information

103
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,740
to a variable.

104
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,660
And then we'll change that information.

105
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,420
And then we'll send it back in.

106
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,820
So let's do that by first setting a variable.

107
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,260
Going to go here.

108
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,700
And we're going to set a variable.

109
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,740
Let's actually create one called chart options.

110
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,260
There we go.

111
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:57,020
And we'll drop down chart options in here.

112
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,260
We'll put that in.

113
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:02,260
And now we have that captured in a variable, which

114
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,380
allows us, of course, to change those options.

115
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:10,500
Now, since this particular list is in that key value format

116
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,940
that we talked about in an earlier video,

117
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:16,220
the easiest way to change it would be to go up here

118
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,940
and to open our library and look for the structured data

119
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,820
library.

120
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,060
Here we go.

121
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,600
And as you remember, structured data

122
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,540
allows us to make changes based on a key.

123
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,940
Then we can change the value.

124
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,780
So that should appear down here.

125
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,260
And that allows us to bring over this block set value.

126
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:38,260
And we'll bring it over a couple of times here.

127
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,820
And so we'll go over and we'll get our chart option,

128
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,580
because that's what we want to be setting.

129
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,020
And that's the list that we're working with.

130
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:49,340
Let's bring over another chart option here.

131
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,300
OK, whoops, in the wrong slot.

132
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,540
There we go.

133
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:56,300
And the first thing that we want to change is title.

134
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,340
Or title doesn't have any information right now.

135
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,620
So we want to change our title to something.

136
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:10,180
And we'll say CO2 in the atmosphere.

137
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,500
OK, we'll get that as the title.

138
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,300
Then the other thing that we want to change

139
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,140
is the y-axis here.

140
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,780
So there's the x-label and there's the y-label.

141
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:23,580
So we'll change this one down here to y-label.

142
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:28,340
And the y-label, we're going to label as parts per million,

143
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,260
PPM.

144
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,420
Oops, there we go, parts per million.

145
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:35,380
OK, now if I run this, you see that our chart option now

146
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,300
has CO2 in the atmosphere.

147
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:41,380
And it should have a label, PPM, under the y-label.

148
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,780
And now we can simply apply those as our new options

149
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,300
and call the chart again.

150
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,740
So those options are captured in this variable here.

151
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,180
And if we run this, and we turn off this

152
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,620
so we can see it a little bit better, if we run this,

153
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:01,820
now the chart has a title and it has a y-axis label.

154
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,140
All right, and if we want to just put everything together,

155
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:08,980
so it's one nice unit, we can do that.

156
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,380
Bring this down here.

157
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,820
There we go, connect it.

158
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:17,500
All right, and let's put a block on top of it

159
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,980
when Greenfly clicked.

160
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:23,300
And we'll click it.

161
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,180
And it ran.

162
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:29,300
So again, it went out with an RPC to fetch the data set.

163
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,100
And then it went out to find the default options.

164
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,140
We changed some of those options.

165
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:39,180
And then we called the GNU plot with our new options

166
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,180
and the data.

167
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:43,180
And we got this visualization.

168
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:48,140
All right, and we did that in just a handful of blocks.

169
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,300
So that wraps it up.

170
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,100
Thank you very much again for joining me.

171
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,340
And I look forward to seeing you in my next video.
