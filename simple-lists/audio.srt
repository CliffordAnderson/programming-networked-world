00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
Hi everyone. Welcome back to our series on programming for a networked world.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,400
Today we're talking about lists. We all have experience making lists.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,520
Every day I add items to my list of things to do.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:16,000
For example, I added a reminder to make a video today about lists.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So, now I can cross that item off my to-do list.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,200
Lists in Nextbox function in a similar fashion.

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,880
Nextbox allows programmers to create lists, add items to lists,

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,840
find items on lists, and remove items from lists.

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,800
Lists also help programmers to manage related items of information.

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,200
Ready to recreate your virtual to-do list in Nextbox?

11
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,560
Let's make some lists together.

12
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,280
Lists are a fundamental data structure in Nextbox.

13
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:55,040
Lists come in all shapes and sizes, but we'll begin by covering the simplest

14
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,960
form of list. That is a one-dimensional list.

15
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,120
A one-dimensional list is a fancy name for a list that just contains a

16
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,680
sequence of things like numbers, strings, sprites, etc.

17
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,120
We can create a list of this simple sort by

18
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:16,560
going over to the variable palette and pulling out the list block.

19
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,720
In that input slot we can just put, let's see,

20
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:28,720
script a video. And if we want to add something else I can

21
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,120
expand this block and say

22
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,080
film a video. If you click on the list block now

23
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,880
you'll notice that we have a pop-up. It gives us the items in the list back

24
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,680
next to the numbers 1 and 2. So, as you can imagine,

25
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,440
those are the first and second items in the list.

26
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,440
In some languages the first item in the list is indexed as 0

27
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:00,560
and the second item as 1. In Nextbox we follow the more intuitive system

28
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,840
of numbering the first item as 1 and the second as 2

29
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,960
and so on and so forth. But that is called the

30
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,360
index of the item. It gives you a number by which you can look up that item

31
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,840
in the list. Adding items to our list by just expanding the list block

32
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,040
and adding them manually will get boring over time.

33
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,960
We'd rather have our program do this for us, right? Not just do it by hand.

34
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,320
Fortunately we can add new items programmatically as well.

35
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,360
So, for instance, we can add a third item,

36
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,080
say like edit video to our list, using the add to list block.

37
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,760
We'll type in the item that we want to add to our list and then we'll bring

38
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,400
down the list and hopefully it'll all work. Let's take a

39
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,680
look. So the four blocks that you see down here

40
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,760
are command blocks that mutate lists. That is, they'll change the information

41
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,520
contained in a list. And the four blocks, as you can see, are

42
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,440
add, delete, insert, and replace. We're going to try

43
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,400
all four of them, but let's start with the add block.

44
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,840
So I can bring over the add block here and

45
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,120
this little slot here with the alternating red and white

46
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,240
is the slot for the list. And then I can add

47
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,480
a thing. Let's give it a name. Let's say

48
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,240
produce video. So I can type that in, produce

49
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:24,800
video, and then I can click on it. Ah, but nothing happened.

50
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,520
Why didn't anything happen? Well, this is a command block

51
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,680
and it mutated the list, but it didn't show us the result.

52
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,160
So in order for us to see what the result is, we need to create a variable

53
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:43,280
first to contain our list. So I will create a variable called to do.

54
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,440
Let's go up to the top here and make a variable.

55
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,840
And I'll call the variable to do. There we go.

56
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,960
And now what I'm going to do is I'm going to bring over this set block

57
00:03:54,960 --> 00:04:00,560
and I'm going to drop this list in and I'll call it to do.

58
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,640
And now I can take that reference here and put it down here. So you can see

59
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,320
if I bring up the watcher now, after I set it,

60
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,400
I've got two items in my list. But when I add

61
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,280
another item, it will appear as the third item in the list.

62
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,960
And there you go. So I've just mutated the list by adding a third

63
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,560
item to it. So now the list contains three items.

64
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,080
So let's try our hand at the three other blocks that mutate lists.

65
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:34,400
The delete block, the replace block, and the insert block. These blocks all

66
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,040
work with the index of the items in the list.

67
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,360
To use them, you need to know where the item you want to remove or insert or

68
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,320
replace falls in the list. So for example, if I have finished the

69
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,440
script for the video, I should delete that from my to-do list.

70
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,600
I can use the delete block to do that. And since I know that that was the first

71
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,640
item on my list, it's very easy to get the index. It's

72
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:01,600
just index one. So let's try that. I'll go over here

73
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:09,680
and bring in delete. Delete item one of. Let's duplicate this to-do list.

74
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,760
And I'll bring it down here. Put it in the slot. Delete item one.

75
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:18,080
You can see I've finished now scripting the video.

76
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,480
The second thing that I need to do is let's add a third thing. I want to produce

77
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:27,360
the video. I've got that. So let's say upload it to YouTube. So let's say

78
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:35,760
upload video to YouTube. How about that? Spell that correctly.

79
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,520
Okay, so I'm going to add that, but I don't want to add it as my first item, so

80
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,720
that's not the right place to put it. I'm going to insert it now.

81
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,280
If I can get that text again so I don't have to retype it all.

82
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:58,080
And put it down here. And I'm going to insert that as number

83
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,440
three. So I'll put it at the end of the list. So there we go.

84
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,880
Oh, yes, if you don't put the list in, you will see that error message.

85
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:15,920
So I'll put the list in and insert it. And there it is. Upload video.

86
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:20,480
Okay, oh, misspelled. So I misspelled it. That's actually helpful because now I

87
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,720
want to replace it with something that's spelled correctly.

88
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,560
So let's do that. So I'm going to take this

89
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,760
replace item, and I want to replace number three.

90
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:34,640
And I want to use the same list. So I'll duplicate the list here.

91
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:42,400
Put it in. And again, I'll click and copy this. But before I change it, I want to

92
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,520
change this O to a P so it's spelled correctly. So you see we

93
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,240
have UOLOAD. And if I click on this now,

94
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,120
oh, don't need it connected with another block. If I click on this now,

95
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,800
you can see that it replaced it to upload video.

96
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,000
So with the combination of these four blocks,

97
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,760
you can make lists contain any type of information you want,

98
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,360
and you can keep it updated in real time as information

99
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,240
in the program changes. So keeping track of information using lists is an

100
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,520
extremely common task in Nest Blocks. Practically every application you write

101
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,520
will involve the use of lists. Many times it will involve the use of

102
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,800
multiple lists. In this video, we saw how to create a

103
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,000
one-dimensional list and mutate it by adding, deleting,

104
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,160
inserting, and changing items. But lists can do more than store your

105
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,600
to-do items. In the next video, we'll explore how to

106
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:44,800
use two-dimensional lists to store and explore tabular information.

107
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,800
But that's it for today. If you want to do something for extra credit,

108
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,640
then try building your own to-do list in Nest Blocks.

109
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,640
And don't forget to add watch the next video in this series

110
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:02,560
to that to-do list. Thanks very much, and see you next time.
