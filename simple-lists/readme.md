# Introduction to Lists in Nextbox

Welcome to the lesson on *lists* in Nextbox. Lists are a fundamental data structure that help programmers manage related items of information. We will begin with one-dimensional lists, which contain sequences of items like numbers, strings, sprites, etc. To create a one-dimensional list, we use the variable palette and pull out the list block. Each item in the list has an *index*, which is a number you can use to look up that item.

In Nextbox, we can add items to a list programmatically using command blocks that mutate lists. There are four such blocks: *add*, *delete*, *insert*, and *replace*. To see the results of these blocks, we need a variable to contain our list, and then we can use the command block on that variable. These blocks work with the index of items in a list, so understanding the position of items in a list is important.

With the combination of these four blocks, you can create and manage lists containing any type of information you want, keeping it updated in real time as the information changes. Practically every application in NetsBlox will involve the use of lists, often involving multiple lists. Today we covered creating and mutating one-dimensional lists. In the next video, we will explore the use of two-dimensional lists for storing and exploring tabular information.

## Key takeaways from this lesson

- Lists are fundamental data structures in Nextbox, helping manage related items of information.
- One-dimensional lists contain sequences of items, each with an index for look-up.
- Four command blocks for mutating lists are: add, delete, insert, and replace.
- Understanding the index of items in a list is important for using these command blocks.
- Lists are essential in NetsBlox applications, with more advanced applications involving multiple lists and two-dimensional lists.
