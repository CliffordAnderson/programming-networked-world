# Introduction to FizzBuzz with NetsBlocks

Welcome everyone! Today, we will be exploring the FizzBuzz problem, which is a popular programming interview question. FizzBuzz is a children's game that requires you to evaluate and respond to changing conditions. We will be solving FizzBuzz in NetsBlocks using *conditional logic*, specifically the logic of if-then-else expressions. By the end of the lesson, you will be proficient in branching.

First, let's understand the rules of FizzBuzz. The game involves counting up from 1, and if the number is divisible by 3, we say "Fizz" instead of the number. If the number is divisible by 5, we say "Buzz" instead of the number. And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, we say "FizzBuzz". If none of those conditions apply, we simply say the number itself. To express these conditions in code, we'll use *Boolean logic* and the *modulus (mod)* operator. Our goal is to create Boolean expressions that evaluate the divisibility conditions and then implement them in our NetsBlocks code.

Now that we have our Boolean expressions set up, we'll create conditional tests using both the *if block* and *if-else block* in NetsBlocks. We'll apply these blocks along with our Boolean expressions to set up exclusive branches for our FizzBuzz conditions. In other words, we will create conditions where a number can either be Fizz, Buzz, FizzBuzz, or the number itself. By inserting these conditions in a repeat block, we can control how many numbers we want to evaluate in our sequence.

## Key takeaways from this lesson:

- FizzBuzz is a popular programming interview question that tests your understanding of conditional logic.
- NetsBlocks allows us to solve FizzBuzz using if-then-else expressions and Boolean logic.
- Implementing FizzBuzz requires understanding the order of conditions and the importance of properly structuring exclusive branches.
- The modulus (mod) operator is useful for determining whether numbers are divisible without a remainder.
- Learning to walk through branches and debug errors in logic is an essential skill for mastering conditional programming.
