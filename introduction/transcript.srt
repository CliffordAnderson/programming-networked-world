00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
Hi, everyone. Welcome back to Programming for a Network World.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:08,780
Today, we're going to explore the basics of the NetsBlox interface.

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,320
Our goal today is to help you to get oriented in NetsBlox,

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,520
so that you'll know where all the pieces

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,760
are as we continue our programming journey.

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,640
We'll explore how to write a simple program in

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,440
NetsBlox and look at the different components of

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:29,440
NetsBlox so that you'll know your way around as we go through this course.

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:36,240
Are you ready to find out how to program in NetsBlox? Let's get started.

10
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,000
Let's begin with just how to get to NetsBlox.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,200
If you type NetsBlox into a browser,

12
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,520
www.netsblocks.org, you'll get to this page.

13
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,400
To get to the NetsBlox programming environment,

14
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,280
you can click Try Now.

15
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,360
That URL is editor.netsblocks.org.

16
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,440
That will bring you to this page where we'll do all of our programming.

17
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,080
Now, one of the things that you'll want to do is to

18
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,880
create your own account in NetsBlox.

19
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,980
An account allows you to keep your programs in one place,

20
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,400
they'll keep them private to you,

21
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,120
but you can also share out your programs with others.

22
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,440
To do that, we'll click here on this Cloud icon,

23
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,640
and you can see that I'm already logged in.

24
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,240
But if I were logged out,

25
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,840
I would have another option here,

26
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,160
and that is to sign up.

27
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,480
You can sign up here,

28
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,120
just put in this information,

29
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,400
and then click OK.

30
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,720
You'll have to agree to the terms of service,

31
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:42,360
and then you can log in with your username and password,

32
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,120
just like any normal site.

33
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:51,080
Let's try it again. There we go.

34
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,280
Now, I'm logged in under my name.

35
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,760
That's the first thing that you want to do is to create an account on

36
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,800
NetsBlox as you go through this course

37
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,880
to keep all of your exercises in one place.

38
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,960
Now, let's just talk about

39
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,360
the various parts of the NetsBlox interface.

40
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,320
Up here, we have the toolbar that we've already used,

41
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,920
and there are several important features up

42
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,960
there that we'll get to in a little while.

43
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,600
Then over here, we have the palette.

44
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,760
This is where you have the three main types

45
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,680
of blocks that we're going to be using,

46
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,320
namely command blocks.

47
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,560
Those have this notch right here.

48
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,200
Then reporter blocks, for example,

49
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,360
they have the rounded edges like these.

50
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,000
These are reporter blocks.

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,240
Reporter blocks differ from command blocks because

52
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,440
command blocks do things in the NetsBlox environment,

53
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,040
whereas reporter blocks report things about the environment.

54
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,040
That distinction will become clear as we go forward in this course.

55
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,640
The third type of block here is with this pointy arrows.

56
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,440
This is a special type of reporter called a Boolean,

57
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,000
and it always reports true or false.

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,080
Again, we'll learn more about Booleans

59
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,960
later in this particular unit.

60
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,960
These are your blocks,

61
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,760
and that will be the functionality that we'll use.

62
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,120
What we'll do is we're going to pull these blocks

63
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,360
out onto the scripting area.

64
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,560
This is what this is right here.

65
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,200
This is where we do our scripting or write our programs.

66
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,320
You can see we'll just create a simple program.

67
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,640
We're going to go to the Network tab here,

68
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,840
and I'm going to bring out this call block.

69
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,600
You can see because it has the rounded edges that it is a reporter.

70
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,080
I'll drop down and you'll see

71
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,520
that there's lots of different choices here.

72
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:41,160
Now, these are what are called RPCs, Remote Procedure Calls.

73
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,880
That is, they can get data from all over

74
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,360
the web and bring it back to your NetBlocks program.

75
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,360
We're going to be exploring RPCs in depth in this course

76
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,800
because it's one of the themes of programming in a network world.

77
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,680
But you may see as we go on that this menu

78
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,760
changes over the period of the course,

79
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,920
and it may actually change in your own environment.

80
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,680
That's simply because we're adding new RPCs all the time,

81
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,920
and sometimes we reorganize them to

82
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,600
just collect them and make them a little bit more clear.

83
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:16,040
I'm going to go down to GeoData and to weather and click on that,

84
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,720
and you'll see that now I've got this RPC.

85
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,000
It's a little bit different. It has a dropdown here.

86
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,080
I want to drop that down and you see that I've got several options.

87
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,400
I could get, for example,

88
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:30,400
the humidity, I can get icons representing the weather in a particular area.

89
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,640
What I want to do is get the temperature.

90
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,880
Now, two more spaces for blocks open up.

91
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,880
This is really one of the ways that you'll program in Nest Blocks.

92
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,240
When you have these particular spaces to fill in blocks,

93
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,040
then you'll look for other blocks that you want to use to fill them.

94
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,640
Now, in this particular one,

95
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,880
to get the temperature of where I'm located,

96
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,080
I want the latitude and longitude.

97
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,120
I can look that up in some service,

98
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,760
and it would tell me maybe on

99
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,320
Google Maps what my latitude and longitude is.

100
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,440
But I can also go over to sensing,

101
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,840
and I can find a block over here called my latitude and my longitude.

102
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,880
Again, I can bring these into the scripting area just like so,

103
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,160
and I can then bring them right into these slots.

104
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,280
Make sure you drop it in the right slot like that.

105
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,840
To test this, I simply click on it,

106
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,400
and you see here that there's a pop-up saying

107
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,840
that the editor wants to know my location.

108
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,960
Now again, in order for this to work,

109
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,560
you have to allow that,

110
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,200
and I've got that turned off in the Mac,

111
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,720
so let's make sure it's turned on,

112
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,280
and I'm going to go to location settings here.

113
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,240
This is Mac specific,

114
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:48,120
but let's get this done for this browser,

115
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,080
and let's see if I can do that.

116
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,240
There we go. That should have it done,

117
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,520
and let's try it again.

118
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:05,720
This time, it came back with 67.9 degrees Fahrenheit.

119
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:10,080
We are using Fahrenheit in this particular service.

120
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,720
You see that you may have some setup to do in your own browser simply to allow

121
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,200
the browser to fetch that information for you based on your location,

122
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,480
and that can differ between browsers.

123
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:25,440
But in any case, once you have that setup in Nest Blocks,

124
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:30,280
it will always return the temperature that it is right now,

125
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,320
67.9 where I am, it's a nice day.

126
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:37,280
Now, let's build a little program around that,

127
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,880
and I'll introduce as we build a program

128
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,240
to other parts of the Nest Block programming environment.

129
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,160
The first is the stage.

130
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,880
This is where in some sense your programs will show their results.

131
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,720
The stage is an important area where you can draw,

132
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,800
you can have what are called sprites or turtles,

133
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,440
and the stage is in some sense where the action happens in your program.

134
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,840
You can see here I've got this default little arrow, that's a turtle.

135
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,560
We'll learn about turtle graphics coming up in a little bit.

136
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,720
But this is also something important.

137
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,280
This is your sprite corral.

138
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,160
This is where your sprites for your program will be contained.

139
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,960
Now, sprites are how you organize your programs.

140
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,560
This code, for example, is inside of a particular sprite,

141
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,800
this sprite right here.

142
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,720
If I click on the stage, you'll see that the scripting area becomes blank,

143
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,720
and that's because I can also write programs that are specific to the stage.

144
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,840
But we're going to be writing here in this sprite,

145
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,640
and you may have many sprites,

146
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,680
and they may contain different types of code.

147
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,520
So you'll need to know where you're writing your code

148
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,920
and what sprite is going to be responding to the commands

149
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,400
that you use inside of your code.

150
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,000
So here, we'll just use this particular sprite.

151
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,600
That's the default sprite that looks like the arrow,

152
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,880
and you can see that it will respond,

153
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:04,440
but we need to use something other than a reporter to do that.

154
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,160
So this is just reporting this information.

155
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,800
This is why there's that pop-up.

156
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,560
But in order for the sprite to do something,

157
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,320
we need to use the command block.

158
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:15,240
And so the simplest command we can use is let's go under looks here,

159
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,840
and I'm going to take this C block out,

160
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,840
and let's drop this whole thing into say.

161
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,880
Now, what I can do is click on this,

162
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,760
and you'll see that it will fetch the information,

163
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:32,160
and then it will have the sprite say 67.9 degrees.

164
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,160
But of course, that number is not very helpful or informative.

165
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:39,080
So let's make this program a little more interesting.

166
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,720
So if we go over to operators, we can go down to this join block,

167
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,800
and this helps join two pieces of text together.

168
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,280
In computer science, text is often called string,

169
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,200
so it will join strings together.

170
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,600
And we can take this particular block and drop it in here,

171
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:01,640
and we can say the temperature is now,

172
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,560
and I'll put a space after that.

173
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,960
And actually, I can click this little arrow

174
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:11,040
and then put another space and say Fahrenheit like that.

175
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,680
Let's pull this back so you can see the whole thing.

176
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,000
Now, I've got a string here that will say the temperature is now,

177
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,560
and then 67.9 degrees or whatever the temperature is where you are,

178
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,400
Fahrenheit to make sure that we're not talking about Celsius.

179
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,720
And if I click on that, it will report that information to me

180
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,800
in the form now of a sentence.

181
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,000
So you can see it's much more readable.

182
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,880
And then I can bring this back into that slot here,

183
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:41,080
and now I can have the sprite say that sentence for two seconds.

184
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,760
If I wanted to stay on the screen a little bit longer,

185
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,520
I could change that to five seconds.

186
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:50,000
And there you go.

187
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,040
Now, one last thing as we explore the utility in Nest Blocks,

188
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,320
I'm going to bring out this when green flag clicked.

189
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,920
This is called a hat block,

190
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,800
and the hat block can sit on top of the stacks of blocks that you build,

191
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,120
and then you can activate it by hitting this green flag.

192
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,080
Oftentimes, people have a hat block in their program

193
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,000
because it's the way that they kick off the computation of their program

194
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
rather than just directly clicking on a stack of blocks.

195
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,320
So let's try that.

196
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,360
I'm going to click green.

197
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,760
You see that the highlight is around it.

198
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,760
There's a little bit of glow around it.

199
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:27,520
And then the command makes the sprite say that information on the stage,

200
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,960
and then it no longer is glowing.

201
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,360
That means the computation is over.

202
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,600
All right, so there's a lot more to learn about Nest Blocks,

203
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,120
but the purpose here was just to show you how to write a very simple program

204
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:45,640
as we explore the different parts of the Nest Blocks programming environment.

205
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,280
I hope you've enjoyed this video,

206
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,880
and I look forward to seeing you in the next episode.
