# Introduction

In this video, you will learn about the basics of the NetsBlox interface. Our goal is to help you get oriented in NetsBlox so that you know where all the pieces are as we continue our programming journey. By the end of this video, you will be able to write a simple program in NetsBlox and understand the different components of the interface.

To get to NetsBlox, we will type www.netsblocks.org into a browser and click on "Try Now" to access the programming environment at editor.netsblocks.org. We will also learn how to create our own account in NetsBlox, which allows us to keep our programs in one place and share them with others.

The NetsBlox interface has several important features, including the toolbar and the palette. The toolbar contains various tools that we will use throughout the course, while the palette is where we can find the three main types of blocks: command blocks, reporter blocks, and boolean blocks. 

We will also learn how to write a simple program in NetsBlox, using the blocks to move a sprite across the screen. This will help us understand how the different components of NetsBlox work together to create a program.

By the end of this video, you will have a solid understanding of the NetsBlox interface and be ready to start programming in NetsBlox. You will also know how to create an account and keep your
programs organized in one place.
