# Introduction

In this video, you will learn about the basics of the NetsBlox interface. Our goal is to help you get oriented in NetsBlox so that you know where all the pieces are as we continue our programming journey. By the end of this video, you will be able to write a simple program in NetsBlox and understand the different sections of the interface, such as the stage, the palette, the scripting area, the sprite coral, etc. You will also learn to differentiate the three main types of blocks: command blocks, reporter blocks, and boolean blocks.

To get to NetsBlox, we will type www.netsblocks.org into a browser and click "Try Now" to access the programming environment at editor.netsblocks.org. You will also learn how to create your own account in NetsBlox, which allows you to keep your programs organized and, if you want, to share them with others.

By the end of this video, you should have a solid understanding of the NetsBlox programming environment and be ready to start building programs in NetsBlox.
