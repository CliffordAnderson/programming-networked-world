00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello, everyone. Welcome back to our series on programming for a networked world.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Today, we're going to be talking about events.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So, events take place in the world all around us,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and we oftentimes have to respond to those events in appropriate ways.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
For example, if someone's walking down the street and calls out,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Hey, Cliff!

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Then my response should be,

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Hey, how are you?

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
If I just walk on by and I don't respond,

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
that's also a type of event, but not a very friendly one.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So, when events occur,

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
our computer code also needs to respond to the user in such appropriate ways.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
That means, as programmers,

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
we have to respond to those events by capturing them

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and then setting a setup box up to respond to them appropriately.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We're going to learn how to do that in this video.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So, ready to trap events and respond to them appropriately?

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Let's get started.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Okay, today our plan is actually very simple.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
We're going to make a program that draws on the screen when we hold our mouse down.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
To do that, we need to be able to capture the mouse down event.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So, I'm going to go over here to Control,

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and then I'm going to pull over this hat block that has a space for a Boolean,

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and there is a built-in mouse down detector

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
that will return a Boolean whenever the mouse is down or up.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And so, if the mouse is down, then this hat block will execute.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So, we just need to then put in code to respond to the event of the mouse being down.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Since we want to draw, let's put in code to draw on the screen.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So, we'll put in firstPinDown.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And now, I think we should also switch our costume,

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
so Ada will become a turtle again. It's easier to draw with.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And then we want to have the mouse go to the location on the screen where our pointer currently is.

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And so, for that, we're going to go to x, y,

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
but we have to sense where the x and y are of our mouse.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So, it'll be mouseX and mouseY.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Now, you notice that the line disappeared on the screen here, and why is that?

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Well, because my event is already wired up.

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So, when I let go of the mouse, or when I clicked on it,

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
it went off to the side somewhere on the stage,

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
went off the stage onto the side of the screen where you can't see it.

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So, we'll have to handle that in a moment.

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
But for now, let's just finish up this event,

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
and then when the event is over, we want to put the pin up, like this,

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
and now we've got a tool to help us draw on the screen.

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You can see here that we can start drawing lines using this event,

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
just by capturing our mouse down button.

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
But as I said, we probably want to make it a little bit easier for people to get started,

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
so we can also capture the event of the when green flag is clicked.

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And we've actually already seen this in other of our programs,

50
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
we just haven't called it out as an event.

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
So, let me bring when green flag clicked is over,

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
and now we put in some starter code that helps us to get a line properly for our drawings.

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So, we should probably put in under pin that will clear the stage,

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
and we'll set the pin color to red, say,

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
and we'll set the pin size to make it a little bit bigger,

56
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
so that it's a little bit more striking.

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
There we go, that's three, that's good.

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And we also might want to just start right at the beginning of the,

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
right in the center of the stage,

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
so that we don't start awkwardly off to the side by having to click on when mouse is down.

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So now you can see, when we do that, we start at the center of the stage,

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
and I can draw, oh, that's not a very good triangle.

63
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Maybe we should add another event that allows me to erase what I've done so far,

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
and then start over again without having to click on the green flag.

65
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Because if I do that, you'll see that there's a line that goes up,

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
and then disappears when I go off the screen,

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
because it's trapping my event of clicking on the green flag.

68
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So maybe we should add one more event that responds to a click of the space key.

69
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Now you notice in this particular hat block,

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
we can drop down and see that it can respond to any key.

71
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The space key is just a convenient one, because it's big and easy to locate.

72
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So now, when we hit the space key, what we're going to do is we're going to clear,

73
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,000
and then we'll go back to the centers.

74
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So let's do that, too, like this.

75
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Okay, ready to try it?

76
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So we hit the green flag.

77
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Let's say I draw something like that.

78
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm not really happy with that triangle,

79
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
so rather than going up in here and clicking again,

80
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm just going to hit the space key, and there I can do that again.

81
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So that's a quick introduction to events,

82
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
but you can combine events with something called messages

83
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
to create much more complex effects in your program.

84
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So in our next video, we'll go deeper with events,

85
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
and we'll also introduce the concept of messaging.

86
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
But for now, you've learned how to trap events,

87
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
and then add blocks to handle them when they occur.

88
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
All right, so I'll see you in our next video.
