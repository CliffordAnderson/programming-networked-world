# Introduction to Events in Programming

Welcome back to our series on programming for a networked world. Today we'll be discussing *events* and how to respond to them in computer code. Events take place all around us, and it is crucial for our code to respond to user interaction, such as clicks and key presses, appropriately. In this lesson, we'll learn how to capture events and set up our code to respond to them.

We will start by creating a simple program that draws on the screen when the mouse button is held down. To achieve this, we need to capture the *mouse down event*. Our code will then respond to this event by drawing on the screen, using coordinates from our mouse's x and y position. We'll also demonstrate how to handle additional events, such as clicking the green flag to reset the drawing or pressing the space key to clear the screen and return to the center.

While this is only a basic introduction to events, they can be combined with *messages* to create more complex effects in your programs. In our next lesson, we'll delve deeper into events and explore the concept of messaging. But for now, you've learned how to capture events and handle them in your code.

## Key takeaways from this lesson:
- Events allow our code to respond to user interactions, such as clicks and key presses.
- We can capture events like the mouse down event and set up our code to respond accordingly.
- Additional events can be introduced to provide more functionality, such as clearing the screen or resetting the drawing.
- Events can be combined with messages to create more complex effects in a program.
- In future lessons, we'll go deeper into events and explore the concept of messaging.
