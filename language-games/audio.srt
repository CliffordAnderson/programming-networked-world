00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,440
Hi, welcome back everyone to Programming for a Network World. Today we're going to

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,800
wrap up our sessions on textual analysis in Netsbox and we're going to do

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,000
something fun. I don't know if you've seen the channel Translation Fails. I

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
think they changed their name to Twisted Translations, but the idea is that they

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,520
take song lyrics and then they run it through Google Translate multiple times

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,800
and whatever comes out is what the performer sings. So we're going to make

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,240
our own Translation Fails in this particular section and we're going to do

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,640
that by combining two RPCs that are built into Netsbox. So are you ready to

9
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,560
mess with song lyrics? Let's get started.

10
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,640
Okay, so here's what we're going to do. We're going to take out from the

11
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:55,160
Network tab over here the first RPC that we're going to use and if we drop down

12
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:02,240
we'll see here under music that we have access to Genius. Now for those of you

13
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,960
that don't know Genius, it's a site that gives you information about songs and

14
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,040
song lyrics and you can see here that if you drop down you'll see that you have

15
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,920
Get Artist, Get Song, Get Song Lyrics. Now all of these, if you click on them, will

16
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,000
take an ID. So we need to find out what that ID is first and the way we do that

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:30,160
is to search for songs. So let's just look for the song Don't Stop Believing.

18
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:38,160
I think that's how you spell it. And we get back actually 10 that have that

19
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:44,480
match. Let's take a look. Let's actually just go in and take a look at

20
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:51,080
this a little more carefully by getting the first item. There we go. So item one

21
00:01:51,080 --> 00:02:00,000
and that gives us this chart here. Don't Stop Believing. This one is by The Rock.

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Oops, if I can pull this across. The Rock of Ages movie. Okay, but in any case we can

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,400
use this version of the song Don't Stop Believing to get our ID which is the

24
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:19,800
first item there. So let's go over and just get our library for structured data

25
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,920
that we've used before just to make it clear what we're doing. So let's get

26
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:31,280
structured data, bring it in, go to custom, and let's get the value of that. So we're

27
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,000
gonna drop that in here and we'll get the ID. I can't remember if it's

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,720
capitalized or lowercase. Okay, so we did it in caps and there it is. So that gives

29
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,280
us the ID of the song and now if we want to get the lyrics all we need to do is

30
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,200
call it again for the lyrics with that ID. So let's go to network here and go

31
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:56,200
over and back down to music and to Genius and we're gonna get the song

32
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:03,000
lyrics and then we're gonna drop this in here and there we go. Don't Stop Believing.

33
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,880
That looks like the song that we're looking for. Okay, and I see this one is

34
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,520
sung by two singers so I think they're indicating who's singing

35
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,440
what part so that's why we're seeing the in brackets there, but that should be

36
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:27,720
fine. Okay, now what we'd like to do is to take these lyrics and then pass them

37
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,520
into Google Translate, shuffle them between languages so they kind of get

38
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:37,280
mixed up and then have Ada present the lyrics back to us in English but in

39
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,720
their kind of mixed up form. So in order to do this we need to start building a

40
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:49,640
program that will allow us to search for the the lyrics that we want, then to

41
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,400
pull out the song lyrics, to tokenize them, to split them into segments by line

42
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,800
and then we're gonna pass them into Google Translate. So the other service

43
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,160
that we are gonna want to use is Google Translate and let's just see how that

44
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:09,600
works before we get started too far. So we're gonna go to language and then you

45
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:14,720
see here is translation and translation has a couple things that we're gonna use.

46
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,440
So one is get supported languages. This is just a list of the languages. I think

47
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:22,240
there are about a hundred, 111 languages that Google Translate supports and

48
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,140
here are their codes. So we'll use those codes. That'll be part of what we use so

49
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:33,580
we'll kind of leave this out here. But also, and let me just duplicate this, we

50
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:39,340
also can translate from language to language. So here we can put in a text

51
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:45,660
and we could say like don't stop believing and we could translate it from

52
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:55,940
English to say Chinese. Invalid key, please update your as your translation

53
00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:04,660
API key. Well that doesn't sound too good. Let's try this again. Let's just try

54
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,220
FLR.

55
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:19,020
Okay, there we go. I think that we were just getting an error code because CN for

56
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:23,540
some reason isn't the code that we want but maybe I'll mention to Brian that we

57
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:27,500
should improve that error message. Okay, so there we go.

58
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:35,900
N'arrÃªtez pas de croire. Don't stop believing in French. All right, so that is

59
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:44,380
good and actually Chinese probably is ZH but anyway we'll leave it as it is. We

60
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:52,780
have to look it up here and find out. Yeah, there it is. ZH on T is traditional

61
00:05:52,780 --> 00:06:03,740
Chinese so let's just try that just to see if we can do it. ZH dash on T.

62
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:16,340
There we go. Something like that. So excuse my Chinese but there you go.

63
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:21,700
Okay, so we can translate between different languages but the idea is in

64
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:26,260
going back and forth between these languages we'll lose some of the

65
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:32,540
exactitude of the translation. Again, this is just a function of machine language

66
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:37,300
transformation that it doesn't capture all the nuances perfectly especially as

67
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:41,460
you move between languages and so that should produce some funny lyrics for us

68
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:49,180
to work with. Okay, so let's now start putting all this together here.

69
00:06:49,180 --> 00:07:00,300
All right, so let's start with just setting up our initial... we'll start with

70
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,660
a win clicked here and this is going to take up a lot of space so we'll see if I

71
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:09,380
can kind of get everything together and let's also put in some space for

72
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:14,340
some variables because we're going to need to use them as we go along but the

73
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,700
first one we'll do doesn't need a variable because we'll just do the

74
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:21,420
sensing that we normally do which is we're going to let Ada ask what song

75
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:29,500
that we're interested in. What song shall I sing? Okay, and then we'll wait for the

76
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:34,060
answer and of course the answer comes in this answer. Now here's where we're

77
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:38,220
going to need our first variable because we want to identify the song that we're

78
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:44,580
going to be talking about. So let's get the song ID. We'll use that as our first

79
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:50,820
variable here and the way that we do that, as you know, is we search the songs

80
00:07:50,820 --> 00:08:01,460
and then we get this ID. So we're going to set that variable here to this but

81
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:06,980
let me move this over here so we've got more space. Okay, so it's not just going

82
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:11,820
to be don't stop believing. We're going to put in the answer there and we'll see

83
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:16,980
what it comes out as. Okay, so that'll and we want to set the song ID to that.

84
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:22,260
Okay, so that will give us the ID and now the next thing we want to get is the

85
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:29,700
song lyrics. So same process as we had before, song lyrics. We're just going to

86
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:35,140
set it to a variable here. So let's go over and set song lyrics to whatever

87
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:43,580
Genius calls with that ID and so we pass in ID here. Okay, and let's just test to

88
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:48,620
make sure that we're getting the results that we want. Let's go down and report

89
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,460
the results just to make sure we're on the right path here. So we should be

90
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:56,460
getting the song lyrics back and we click on this and again I'll say don't

91
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:03,380
stop believing and there the song lyrics come up. So good, we're on the right path

92
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:09,100
so far. Okay, now the only thing that's left to do is to split these into lines

93
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:13,740
and I think it's probably easier not to make another variable to do that. We can

94
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:19,340
just take this operator right here of split and put it into the song lyrics

95
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:23,740
themselves right there. So let's just drop this in here and then we're going

96
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:30,180
to split what comes back by line. So that should give us the various verses of the

97
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:36,820
song. We can test that again just to make sure it's working. I'm gonna have to

98
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:42,140
pick a shorter song. A song with a shorter title I should say. There we go.

99
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:48,380
Okay, it's working. We do have some like spaces that we need to fill in so we'll

100
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:52,660
these we should remove from our list so we'll have to think about how to do that

101
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:57,260
in a moment. But basically we've got everything that we want so the only

102
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:02,340
thing that we might want to do is capture the title of the song. So we

103
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:13,060
could also just do that here by putting the song title. Let's do this in

104
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:22,300
lowercase like we've done. Song title. All right and again with a variable here.

105
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:28,020
Now if you remember when we when we called this to get the information from

106
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:34,820
geniuses that we can actually just duplicate this probably. All right this

107
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:40,740
is item one. When we call this and we say like anything I'll try I am Walrus

108
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:49,260
this time we get the title it's the second item here. So what we'll want to

109
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:53,980
do then is we probably shouldn't call twice it would be better not to do that

110
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:57,660
but I think for sake of expediency I'm going to do that. So I'm just gonna

111
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:04,340
duplicate this here and put this in here and then we're gonna get item two of

112
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:08,940
that. I'm sorry we want item one that's still the same but what we want to

113
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:13,340
change here is title and I think it's lowercase. Let's just see if we're

114
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:20,500
getting the title now. So drop this back in here. Let me pull this out of the way.

115
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:25,140
Okay okay so let's pull this out of the way and just see if we're getting the

116
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:33,260
song title coming back. Should just actually mimic what we're putting in.

117
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:38,220
Yeah okay so that's good it's working. All right so we've got our pieces of

118
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:43,980
information that we need from Genius. Now we need to pass those into Google

119
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:49,020
Translate to do the mix of translations. All right so let's throw this out of the

120
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:55,100
way and we'll keep these pieces here but we don't need this any longer and we

121
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:59,580
don't need this any longer. All right the first thing that we want to do is to

122
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:05,420
create a list of the translations the languages that are supported by Google

123
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:09,180
Translate or Azure Translate in this particular case I think we may be using.

124
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:18,140
So I apologize for Google we may be using Azure. And so here we go let's then

125
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:25,020
fill this in and we'll say languages. Okay I'm gonna put this over to the side.

126
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:30,500
Okay so the languages that are supported we'll just assign to that variable there.

127
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:39,780
So let's do that and let's call and get those languages that are supported.

128
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:46,580
Okay so we're gonna set languages to call translation get supported languages.

129
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:54,380
So that's gonna give us that list that we saw and then we can work with that

130
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:58,980
list to pick languages that we want to translate into. Now this is this is the

131
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:05,540
tricky part we're gonna use this under the variables tab we're gonna use this

132
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:09,140
for each and just to make it clear what we're talking about we're gonna talk

133
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:14,580
about we're gonna work on each verse at a time gonna translate that and so let's

134
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:19,500
get the song lyrics. So for each verse in the song lyrics that's basically what

135
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:27,420
we're gonna iterate through we're gonna translate them. So let's now do a little

136
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:31,540
setup so the starting language that we're going to start with is going to be

137
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:35,420
English so and then the starting translation that we're going to start

138
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:44,540
with is is the verse. So let's do a couple variables inside here oops oops

139
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:52,580
there we go all right script variables we'll put it right here and so we're

140
00:13:52,580 --> 00:14:02,980
gonna start with let's say the the source that's gonna be the the source

141
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:07,740
language and that will be English to start with and then the destination

142
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,900
language that's gonna be a random destination to any language that we

143
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:18,540
choose from that list and then we want our translated text so let's add that

144
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:26,580
whoops I didn't mean to run it there we go let's stop it so we'll say

145
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:34,180
translation okay so that's the three variables that we're going to need for

146
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:43,460
this now to start working on this let's begin by setting the translation to the

147
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:48,340
verse that we're going to use so that's what's coming in that's the original

148
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:52,540
untranslated version so that's going to be the what we start with as our

149
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:58,220
translation and then we're gonna have to send it for translation now remember

150
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:04,420
when I said that there are some lines that don't contain anything so one way

151
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:09,020
we can say it's just if there is a verse if there's any verse at all then we'll

152
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:14,500
do this if there's not we'll skip to the next line so that eliminates those gaps

153
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:21,940
in the verses the the places that came back as just empty spaces okay now let's

154
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:29,980
begin by setting the source because we're working with English songs to set

155
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:35,860
the source to English all right so the source will be to begin with is going to

156
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:43,940
be EN all right let's move this over here we're running out of space maybe if

157
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:51,220
I can pull this down a little bit create more space for us there we go

158
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:58,460
okay that's clearing up our scripting area a little bit okay so if there's a

159
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:03,620
verse we're gonna say okay the starting language is going to be English and now

160
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:09,540
we want to set the destination so let's do another variable here oops under

161
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:23,660
variables we're going to set the destination to now what do we set the

162
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:29,100
destination to well here's where we want to pick a random item so in order to get

163
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,820
a random item let's just look at this Google Translate again I'm going to

164
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:40,740
duplicate this and let's drop this down to that get supported languages so in

165
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:46,300
order to get a random item we will just get a number from one to now we could

166
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:52,100
just put in 111 but that's that's hard coding data and you know as your might

167
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,860
add another language so we're gonna leave our options open so we'll say to

168
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:03,340
the length of this so that's going to be some number that's there actually I

169
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:07,860
shouldn't pick one two I want a random number so let's go over here so I think

170
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:15,740
random might be over here pick random okay that's what I wanted so let's do

171
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:19,220
pick random from one to link that so that should just gives a random number

172
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:25,020
every time good up to the length of the list of translations that are supported

173
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:31,700
by Azure okay and now we just want to pick one of those from this language

174
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:39,820
translation so let's let's call that here and we're just going to use the

175
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:48,300
item of put this in as our list put this in as the number that we want so that

176
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:52,260
will get a random one each time let's just see how it works so now we see we

177
00:17:52,260 --> 00:18:00,300
got AM which is a language code for something I don't know OTQ YUE LZH okay

178
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,580
all these languages I'm not familiar with but what we do see is that we want

179
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,980
item one of it that's the code that we want so we're gonna put item one around

180
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:11,940
this and that should just come out with the code with nothing else okay so we're

181
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:16,540
seeing the codes there okay that's perfect now we don't need to call out

182
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:21,520
twice because we're actually going to use this variable languages that we've

183
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:27,360
set up here so let's pull this whoops that's actually what the length of want

184
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:36,280
to pull this out and we want to put in length of languages and then here we

185
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:40,520
want to pull this out and we just want to put in languages that way we're not

186
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:44,800
calling back and forth we're just using the call that we made one time up here

187
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:49,600
and so then we need to set the destination language to that random

188
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,360
language okay so that's good now we've got our source language and we've got

189
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,840
our destination language so that's awesome all we need to do now is to set

190
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:08,440
our translation so if we've got this we will set those and then let's let's do

191
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:17,760
the translation here under variables and set our translation did it go in let's

192
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:28,200
there we go and set our translation to translate now what we want to translate

193
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:37,680
is the verse here from the source

194
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:51,600
to the destination now I think we're gonna get rid of verse and I'll talk

195
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,640
about why in a moment but we're just gonna start with this translation which

196
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:01,640
is actually already been set it's the same as the verse when it starts okay so

197
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:12,080
we've got that ready now let's just see if we can say the translation

198
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:23,280
all right we're gonna put it in here whoop there we go it's not gonna be

199
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:28,000
hello it's going to be the translation and we'll just have it appear on screen

200
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:34,840
for a moment now let me pull this over and we'll see if it works okay which

201
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:46,400
song so they saying don't stop believing oh yeah we haven't translated it back to

202
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,400
English so we're translating it into random languages that is cool each time

203
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:55,280
a different verse into a different language but we need to remember that

204
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:03,240
after we do that we need to set it back to its its English form okay so let's

205
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:10,840
then duplicate this

206
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:20,200
and put this right here we don't need this twice okay so we're gonna set

207
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:28,760
translation here now here's the trick this source is English but if the second

208
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:35,960
time around it's not so we're gonna need to switch those variables and let's see

209
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:45,400
if we can do this here with variable to set it okay so we're gonna set the

210
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:53,840
source now to the destination so basically swap those variables and then

211
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:59,480
the destination here is going to be English so that's where we end so we

212
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:04,920
know that that's that's hard-coded so source is first English and then we set

213
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:09,080
the destination to a random language and we translate from the source which is

214
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:13,200
English to that random language then we're translating back because we have

215
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,760
to indicate what language it was so now we're translating from the source which

216
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,520
is the random language that we chose back in English and then saying the

217
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:24,920
translation so let's see if that works

218
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:32,680
don't stop believing don't stop believing

219
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:38,960
okay so it's working but if you really want to make it crazy you need to move

220
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:44,720
between languages more than once so let's add in a repeat block and the only

221
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,440
trick here is just getting the repeat block into the right place so here I go

222
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,920
I'm gonna grab repeat I think we'll just do it three times so I'm gonna drop it

223
00:22:54,920 --> 00:23:04,000
in right there and this part here should work

224
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,680
let's see if we go like that okay so we're going to set the destination

225
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:14,720
gonna call the translation I'm gonna switch the source to the destination and

226
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,240
then we're gonna repeat not ten times which would be a lot of calls but three

227
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:27,240
times and then we'll come back and set it to English for our final presentation

228
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:33,120
of what Ada would be singing if we could hear her sing all right that should

229
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,920
produce the wanted effect of really scrambling the lyrics let's try it out

230
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:45,200
all right here we go drumroll should we do I'm the walrus this time if I can

231
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:52,640
spell it I am the walrus okay walrus song

232
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:58,520
he's the one you are and we're all together it's close enough look how they

233
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:09,000
run like pigs out of the guns see how they fly I'm crying cry surah to sitting

234
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:15,880
on the ledge I'm waiting for the pain to come

235
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:22,960
company shirt bloodied class man you're an ugly boy and you let your face grow

236
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:35,640
for a long time choir I'm an egg an egg I'm a walrus goo goo good you well no

237
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:40,240
one really knows what that means anyway so that's hard to translate all right so

238
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,280
we'll wrap it up there this is as you see just a fun exercise showing you

239
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:49,240
again how you can combine two RPCs to create a fun effect if you like extra

240
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:53,360
credit I would encourage you to make a video in which you use this tool to

241
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,360
create those lyrics and then sing it yourself I'd love to see it so thanks

242
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:02,200
very much for watching and we will see you in our next unit
