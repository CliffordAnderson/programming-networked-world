00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,120
Welcome back, everyone, to Programming for a Network

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,000
World.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,600
Today, we're going to be continuing

4
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:09,160
our exploration of peer-to-peer networking within Netsblocks.

5
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,960
So we're going to take this a step further,

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,880
and we're going to take a graphic that we're

7
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,600
going to animate on our Netsblocks screen,

8
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,120
and then we're going to have that continue

9
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,720
to animate on another screen.

10
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,880
That is, to move from one program to another,

11
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,560
but have the kind of illusion of the continuity

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,840
of that animation.

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,440
So you could think about that technique

14
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,840
if you wanted to build a distributed video game

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,880
in some way, maybe even like a Pong game that has players

16
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,400
playing on different sides, and then

17
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,360
the Net is where your animation crosses over

18
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,800
to the other person's program.

19
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,520
But for today, we're just going to do the animation part.

20
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,160
And so to get started, let me turn

21
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,760
to Brian, who's joining me again,

22
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,120
and he'll help us get the animation going.

23
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,240
Well, hello, everyone.

24
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,160
Thank you, Cliff.

25
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,520
So as Cliff said, we're going to be

26
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,200
having this animation running from one computer

27
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,560
across the internet to the other computer.

28
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,440
So specifically, we're going to have

29
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,000
a dog that's running across my computer,

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,920
and then onto Cliff's, and then back to mine,

31
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,880
and so on and so forth.

32
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,240
So before we get into the networking portion of it,

33
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,520
let's first just try to break this problem down

34
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,280
into how can we animate this dog?

35
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,360
How can we get it to actually appear to be running?

36
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,160
So if we jump into our project right here,

37
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,360
we can see I'm starting from a starter template

38
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,800
where we already have a bunch of different costumes

39
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:48,240
which show each different, I guess, frame in this animation.

40
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,080
So if we want to show this illusion of running,

41
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:57,840
all we need to do is change to the next costume

42
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,840
that we have.

43
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,400
We can see that if I click this really quickly,

44
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,640
we get this kind of slow motion, and then we

45
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,280
get this kind of run in slow motion.

46
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,280
So instead of, of course, clicking a bunch of times,

47
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,000
if we want to do something over and over,

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,400
we might want to put it in a loop

49
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,840
so I can get this forever loop.

50
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:23,920
And now we can see that this animates way too fast.

51
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,440
So we can certainly slow this down

52
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,600
to something more reasonable by adding this weight block.

53
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,000
And now we can see that we have this animation of this dog

54
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,280
running at a reasonable speed.

55
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,680
So it's running, but it's running in place.

56
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:48,200
So we might want to certainly have this dog actually

57
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,720
move as it's running as well.

58
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,120
So we can drop this move 10 steps block into our loop.

59
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,040
Now we can see that the dog runs clear off the screen.

60
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,840
OK, so now we have this, the beginning of this program.

61
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:08,200
We were able to show this or animate this dog's running

62
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,520
across our screen.

63
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,880
But we certainly probably wanted to make

64
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,720
a couple of additional tweaks.

65
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,440
For example, when the program starts,

66
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,200
we probably want to start at the beginning of the stage.

67
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,080
And then it would probably be nice to know

68
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,000
when it runs off of the screen.

69
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,360
So let's start by looking at how we

70
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,280
might be able to get the program to animate

71
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,240
the dog running from the beginning of the screen

72
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,760
when the green flag is clicked.

73
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,640
So use this one green flag click block.

74
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,520
And then when the green flag is clicked,

75
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,360
we want to move it to the beginning of the screen.

76
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,200
So let's go to, say, 0, 0.

77
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,480
And that's not really where we want the dog to be.

78
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,240
We probably want it in the bottom left corner here.

79
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:56,160
So we can try something, say, maybe negative 150 for x.

80
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,680
Let's maybe make that negative 175.

81
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,920
Now I can see we're right at the beginning.

82
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,200
Negative 150 for y.

83
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,440
This looks like it's about right.

84
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,840
We've got the dog in the bottom left corner.

85
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,640
And now we probably want to start

86
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,000
at the beginning of the animation.

87
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,720
So we can switch to costume dog 1.

88
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,520
So now we started from the beginning of the animation.

89
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:36,440
And then we can just broadcast some sort of event.

90
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,680
Actually, let's not worry about the broadcast just yet.

91
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,320
Then we can actually just have the animation start.

92
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,280
So now if we click green flag clicked,

93
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,160
we can see the dog starts in the lower left

94
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,840
and runs across the screen.

95
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,760
So it's looking pretty good.

96
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,160
Now we just need to figure out how

97
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,400
to tell when the dog is off the screen.

98
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:00,440
And then Cliff can jump right into the networking portion.

99
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,960
So if we're going to run until we're off the screen,

100
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,520
we probably want to make a new variable that keeps track of if

101
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,440
we are still on the screen.

102
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:14,920
This variable should start with a value of true.

103
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:23,600
And then when we are doing our whole animation portion,

104
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,280
we want to probably only repeat that

105
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,920
until we're off the screen.

106
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,200
So repeat that until we are actually

107
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,680
no longer on the screen or not on screen.

108
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,880
All right.

109
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,120
Now we throw out a forever loop because we're not

110
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,840
going to be doing this indefinitely anymore.

111
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,440
And to make this a little simpler,

112
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,440
I always want to get into the networking portion

113
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,720
since we're also going to need this animation.

114
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,160
But let's put this script out on its own

115
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,040
and actually broadcast an animate event.

116
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,440
So now when I receive this animate event,

117
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,760
we'll just do the animation while we're on the screen.

118
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,720
And let's give this a try.

119
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,200
If you press the green flag, we can

120
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,320
see we're animating, animating, animating.

121
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,880
But we're off the screen now, and our onScreen value

122
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,520
is still true.

123
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,880
And the problem is that there's no point in this loop

124
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,680
where we're checking to see if we're still on the screen.

125
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:30,480
So now we just need to add one more block or one more bit

126
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,720
here where we're setting this onScreen variable

127
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,160
to some expression that determines if we're still

128
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,200
on the screen.

129
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,120
So let's see.

130
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,320
We know that our x position is going to be

131
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:49,000
the important value here.

132
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,960
So we can actually just try to figure out

133
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,320
what the value of x is when we're off the screen

134
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,800
by just running it and just trying to stop it right

135
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,640
when we get off the screen.

136
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,160
There we go.

137
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,600
Let's say 305.

138
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,000
So this is a little bit simplistic.

139
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,880
And there are certainly other ways to do this.

140
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,280
But for now, I think this is sufficient.

141
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:20,680
So we're just going to check to see if this x position value is

142
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:26,320
greater than, let's say, 305.

143
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,280
All right, so now when we, whoops.

144
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,000
So this is actually, so you can see I actually did the opposite.

145
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,920
So I was determining how to tell if you're off the screen,

146
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,880
but this variable is whether or not you're on the screen.

147
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,080
So we want to just change this to a not.

148
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:51,080
We also could just change the sign on the inequality.

149
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,160
All right, so now we see we run off the screen.

150
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:57,120
And as soon as we're off the screen, onScreen is now false.

151
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,280
All right, so now up until this point,

152
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,360
we've been able to create a running dog where

153
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,680
we animate this running dog moving across our screen.

154
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,880
And we know as soon as it gets off the screen.

155
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,960
Now, once it's off the screen, we're

156
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,720
going to need to have it show up on someone else's computer

157
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,640
and then run across that screen as well.

158
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:22,840
So I'm going to go to the room and duplicate my role

159
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:29,320
and name this one Role2 so that when Cliff joins the role,

160
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,200
he'll have the same set of costumes.

161
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,120
So he has everything needed to animate this running dog,

162
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,600
including the scripts that we've made up until this point.

163
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,920
Now, I'm going to invite Cliff and turn it over to him

164
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,160
to finish the networking portion.

165
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,200
All right, thanks, Brian.

166
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,880
So you see I get Brian's invitation.

167
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,600
So I will accept that.

168
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,280
And then, as Brian said, there's his project.

169
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,640
So I get that on my screen, which is fantastic.

170
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,120
You can just double check to see which room I'm in.

171
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,760
I'm in Role2.

172
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,600
I'm in the room, and I'm in Role2 here.

173
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,480
So that's good.

174
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,980
And the only thing is, remember before,

175
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,120
I need to get permission from him

176
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,920
to be able to change his project.

177
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,200
So I'll request permission from Brian.

178
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,840
And now that he's granted that to me,

179
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,120
I can start coding on my side.

180
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,120
So what I need to do then is, as we've seen,

181
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,840
the dog will be running across the screen.

182
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,640
And then when it hits the edge, it stops.

183
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,640
And that's the end of the program so far.

184
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,160
So in order to flip back and let the dog continue

185
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:41,160
running on Brian's end when it's off the screen on my end,

186
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,240
I need to send a message to Brian.

187
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,680
So I need to use this send message block.

188
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:51,120
Now, we want to send the message as soon as that block has

189
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:57,120
turned to that we're at not here.

190
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,000
So let's see.

191
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,880
When we receive, we're going to repeat

192
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,960
until it's not on screen.

193
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,080
So this is setting that as not on screen.

194
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,840
So then after that loop ends is the place I want to put it.

195
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,720
Now, the question is, what do I want to send?

196
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,920
So there is a built-in message.

197
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,400
But we can actually customize your messages.

198
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,080
And this is important because you

199
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,620
may be sending various types of messages back and forth.

200
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,640
And they may actually contain different types of data payload.

201
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,960
And so here, we're going to customize and create

202
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,480
our own message.

203
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,040
The thing is, when you're building a distributed program

204
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,920
like this, it's really crucial that you

205
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,560
know what the type of message is that you're sending.

206
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,920
Because if I just send him any message with any name

207
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,640
and Brian doesn't know what that name is,

208
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,280
he won't be able to know what to receive.

209
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:44,500
So let's just create here a make a message type.

210
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,520
And the name of the message is going to be,

211
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,320
let's call it Enter Dog.

212
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,920
And the field will be, now, what should the field be?

213
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,440
What kind of information am I trying to pass back?

214
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,480
Well, again, to preserve the continuity of the animation,

215
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,920
we actually want to know where the dog is

216
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,000
in terms of its gait.

217
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,680
Like, what is it doing when it's running?

218
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,240
Are its legs together or its legs apart?

219
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,520
And in order to know that, we actually

220
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:13,080
just want to pass back the number of the costume

221
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:13,860
that we're using.

222
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,560
So the costumes all have these numbers here.

223
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,520
And even if they weren't numbered themselves,

224
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,280
there are a numbered sequence here.

225
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,840
So basically, what we want to say

226
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,120
is whatever costume number we're on

227
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,040
is what we're going to pass back.

228
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:34,000
So I'm going to say I'll call this field Costume Number,

229
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,160
just so that's clear.

230
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,160
And so now I have that available to me.

231
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,640
And if I drop down here, I can say Enter Dog.

232
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,280
And you can see that it says Costume Number.

233
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,920
Now, the costume number I can get under Sensing.

234
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,720
And here it says Costume Number of.

235
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,880
And I want to drop down to not the stage, but the dog.

236
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,600
And if I click on that, it'll tell me

237
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,320
that it's right now in 4.

238
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,320
But we're not going to hard code that, of course.

239
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,200
We're just going to drop that in.

240
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,320
Let me make sure I get enough space for you all to see that.

241
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,160
OK.

242
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,800
So that's going to be, oh, wrong slot.

243
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,920
There we go.

244
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,840
And then I need to send this to role 1.

245
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,840
So the message will go back to the role that Brian's in,

246
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,160
but containing the information that Brian

247
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:23,480
needs to keep that animation smoothly running.

248
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,680
Now, the other thing is, when I receive a message back

249
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,320
from Brian, I'm going to need to also handle that on my end.

250
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,640
Otherwise, it would just be like,

251
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,000
as soon as it runs off my screen,

252
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,800
it would never come back.

253
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,160
And so we'll go to Network here.

254
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,560
And we're going to take When I Receive.

255
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,920
And I'm going to drop this down.

256
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,560
And I'm going to get that same message.

257
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,600
So whenever I receive an Enter Dog,

258
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,160
then I need to handle that with some animation on my end.

259
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,800
Now, remember, I'm getting this message

260
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,680
when the dog has run off the side of Brian's screen.

261
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,240
So it should make an entrance on the left hand of my screen

262
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,240
as it continues to run across.

263
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,880
We actually already know where that is.

264
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,320
If we just duplicate this block up here and I pull this down,

265
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,400
that's the starting point.

266
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,280
It's already in there.

267
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:11,520
Now, the thing is, switch to costume Dog 1.

268
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:15,600
That's where we need to say, no, it's actually not Dog 1.

269
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,440
It's the costume number that comes through

270
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,880
when we receive that message.

271
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,520
So we'll replace that.

272
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,520
We want to set onScreen to true.

273
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,560
And then we're going to broadcast back to animate.

274
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,640
And that will do the animation running all the way

275
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:32,720
through until it reaches the end and it's not on screen anymore.

276
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,680
And then we send the message to Brian

277
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,400
to continue the animation on his end.

278
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,520
Brian, I think we've got all the pieces in place.

279
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,240
What do you think?

280
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:40,880
I think so.

281
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,680
Let's give it a try.

282
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,160
All right, now let me bring my screen

283
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,360
and make it a little bit bigger.

284
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,160
So here we go.

285
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,160
And since you're in role 1, why don't you kick us off?

286
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:50,840
Sounds good.

287
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,440
Here we go.

288
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,480
There he is, running across the screen.

289
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,240
And then back to Brian, running across the screen.

290
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,080
And we did it.

291
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:07,640
We did it.

292
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,520
So this dog will just be running forever

293
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,120
unless we give it some instructions otherwise.

294
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,320
But you can see that this could be a great foundation

295
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,240
for building a distributed video game.

296
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,200
And so today, we've learned two things.

297
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:24,000
We've learned how to animate the sprite on your screen

298
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,560
so that it has an illusion of motion.

299
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,040
And we've also learned how to customize messages

300
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,800
so that we can send a custom message

301
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,440
type with different types of data payload

302
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,080
when we're trying to do something that's

303
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,920
more sophisticated than just saying, hello, world.

304
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,000
We'll stop it there.

305
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,240
But thank you for joining us.

306
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,400
And we look forward to seeing you in our next video.
