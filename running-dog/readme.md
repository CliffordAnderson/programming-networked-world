# Introduction to Animating and Networking in Netsblocks

Welcome back, students, to *Programming for a Network World*. In today's lesson, we will learn about animating graphics and peer-to-peer networking within Netsblocks. Our goal is to create a simple animation of a dog running from one computer to another while maintaining the *illusion of continuity* in the animation, which is useful for distributed video games.

First, we will focus on animating a running dog on one computer. This involves using the graphics tools in Netsblocks, such as *costumes* and *loops* to give the appearance of movement. After creating the animation, we will then tackle the task of moving the dog from one computer to another by utilizing Netsblocks' networking features. We'll need to send custom messages between the computers, informing them of the dog's current animation frame for seamless transitions.

By the end of this lesson, you should be capable of creating your own simple animation and networking projects in Netsblocks. Remember that these techniques can be extended to create more complex applications, such as distributed video games.

## Key takeaways from this lesson:
- Animating sprites in Netsblocks can be achieved with the use of costumes and loops, giving the illusion of movement.
- Peer-to-peer networking in Netsblocks allows you to send data across different computers.
- Customizing messages is crucial when building a distributed program; you need to know what the type of message is that you're sending and receiving.
- When sending messages between computers, it is important to communicate the relevant data to keep a smooth animation running.
- The techniques taught in this lesson can be applied to more complex projects, such as distributed video games.
