00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
Hello everyone, Brian here. So today I'm going to show you how we can get started

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,440
doing the assignments for our our course.

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,120
So first of all we're going to click the link that we can find in the assignment description

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:24,960
and it'll pull up Netsbox as shown here. Now this might look like your kind of standard Netsbox

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:31,520
setup, except you might notice if you look in the top center, a little bit off to the right,

6
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:36,400
we have this extensions button. Now this extensions button, which is shown with this

7
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:43,520
little kind of puzzle piece, has an option underneath when we select it for programming

8
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:50,400
for network world, in other words for this course. Now for now, at the time of this recording anyway,

9
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,000
we're just showing one assignment here because this is the example assignment that

10
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,960
I'm going to use to just kind of demonstrate how to submit, but you should see a list of all the

11
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,760
assignments that are available for the course. When you want to start an assignment, first you

12
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,720
just select it from this menu and you'll be prompted about starting, you know, the selected

13
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:15,280
assignment. If you decide to start it, it will open up kind of the starter template or starter

14
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:21,200
project that we'll be working from, and most of them have a similar structure to this one,

15
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:27,280
where we'll have some sort of custom block that we want to open and actually implement.

16
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,320
So in this case, we can see we have this helpful little comment to look inside the block to find

17
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:40,560
the problem. The way that we can actually get started on implementing this block, or in other

18
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,040
words, looking inside the block and finding the problem, is by right clicking on the block and

19
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:51,600
selecting edit. This will open up a block editor where we can just kind of write the code that we

20
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,280
want to, or that's necessary to be able to implement the given block. In this case, the

21
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:04,400
block is just testing if a given number is between some lower and upper bound. So, you know, maybe

22
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:10,080
just as a first pass, I'll just, you know, say that nothing is within the range. Of course, this isn't

23
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:17,200
this isn't going to be an answer we expect to do very well, but it should at least illustrate

24
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:24,960
how we can actually then evaluate our kind of intermediate solution. If we select the extensions

25
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,920
button and go to the, you know, programming for a networked world, you know, option, we can now see

26
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,640
that this menu is updated, so we can see we have two options. We can grade our assignment or we can

27
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,000
submit the assignment. If we select grade the assignment, we'll see that we have a list of tests,

28
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:49,520
one on which only has one passing right now. If I change this from false to true and then

29
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:55,120
rerun the tests, now we can see we have four out of five tests passing. Of course, if this were

30
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,920
an assignment that we were actually using in the course, we probably would like

31
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:04,480
a better solution to get 80 percent, but for this example, this is sufficient.

32
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,360
So if I'm happy with the results that I'm getting, I can either select submit here in this

33
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:18,080
grade assignment window, or there is also a submit option up here. I'm going to select it from this

34
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:24,000
window, and when I click submit, now it'll ask us for our Coursera submission info. So this is where

35
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,040
we can enter our Coursera email address and then the token that's provided on the Coursera website

36
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:37,680
when we go to submit our assignment. All right, and then once you actually select okay, you should

37
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,960
be able to see your results posted on the Coursera website and be ready to jump into the next lesson.

38
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,560
Awesome. See you in the next video.
