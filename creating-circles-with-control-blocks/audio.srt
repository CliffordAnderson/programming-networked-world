00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hey everybody, welcome back to this introductory series on NetsBlox.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,960
I'm Cliff Anderson, a librarian at Vanderbilt University,

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,920
and a member of our Computational Thinking and Learning Initiative.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,120
In our last video, we learned to draw simple shapes on the stage.

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,240
In this video, I'm going to show you how to draw a circle.

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,880
What makes creating a circle that different from a square?

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,720
Stick around to find out.

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,720
So

9
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,520
our goal today is to ask our turtle to draw a circle on the stage.

10
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,600
What's the most straightforward way to draw a circle?

11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,840
Well, we could move a step, turn a degree, then move another step, turn a degree,

12
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,120
and so on and so on until we reach 360 degrees.

13
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,720
So what blocks do we need to carry out that method?

14
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,640
Let's go take a look.

15
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,880
All right, so I'm going to bring over here from the motion palette over here.

16
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,200
I'm going to grab, let's see, turn.

17
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,640
That'll help us to turn a degree.

18
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,120
And this is going to help us move.

19
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,680
So I'll snap that together.

20
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,760
So we want to say turn one degree, and then we want to move one step.

21
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,840
And as you remember from last time, we'll take our pen here.

22
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,800
We're going to say pen down, so we'll do that, and pen up.

23
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,040
Okay, that's great.

24
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,040
Let's take over.

25
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,560
Oh, our sprite has disappeared.

26
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,960
If this ever happens, right click on this and just click show.

27
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,800
There's the sprite.

28
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,080
Let's bring it down to the middle.

29
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,400
Okay, so pen down, turn one degree, move one step, pen up.

30
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,240
Click on this.

31
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,920
We should be able to see, if you look carefully right here, a single dot.

32
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,720
So all we have to do is make 360 of those dots, and we'll be done, right?

33
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,680
So we could do what we did last time and just replicate these blocks.

34
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:18,400
We could right click on this here and say duplicate, and we could duplicate that 360 times.

35
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:24,720
But as I guess you could imagine, that would be a pretty dull way to make a program.

36
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,520
We'd end up with like a huge stack of blocks on the screen that would actually go off the bottom.

37
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,200
So we're not going to do it that way.

38
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,800
Fortunately, there is another way to do this.

39
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,640
And programmers have developed an acronym for avoiding that kind of repetition,

40
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,520
where you just copy blocks over and over again.

41
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:46,720
It's called the DRY principle, or the Do Not Repeat Yourself principle.

42
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,280
The DRY principle basically says that you should find a way of reducing repetition

43
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,280
whenever possible in your program.

44
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,360
If you discover yourself duplicating a set of blocks over and over again,

45
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,280
then you should try another solution.

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,720
In this case, what we need is a control block.

47
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,800
So the set of control blocks are colored yellow in NetsBlocks.

48
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,400
Let's take a look over here.

49
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,600
Let's go up and you can see.

50
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,320
I guess that's yellow.

51
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,080
Maybe like a kind of yellowish brown.

52
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,000
In any case, those are the control blocks.

53
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,280
So these control blocks affect what we call flow of control in a program.

54
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,000
The idea is pretty simple.

55
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,840
Think about reading a book.

56
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,680
If you read a book in English, the text reads from left to right across the page.

57
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:41,040
But if you're reading manga, then you need to read from right to left.

58
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,560
In Chinese, you may find books laid out in various formats,

59
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,440
from left to right across the page,

60
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,800
or perhaps in columns from top to bottom, and then from right to left.

61
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:58,000
And if you try to read a page in a way differently than the publisher intended,

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,560
the individual words on the page will not make sense.

63
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:05,040
A similar idea applies to programming languages.

64
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,120
In NetsBlocks, you need to read programs from top to bottom.

65
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,320
So we start at the top of the set of blocks, and then we work our way down the stack.

66
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:19,840
But we can use control structures to alter that straightforward flow.

67
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,680
For example, if we want to repeat a set of blocks over and over again,

68
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,680
then we can use a repeat block to repeat the set of blocks

69
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,240
inside of that block a certain number of times before moving on to the blocks below it.

70
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,880
So if we look over here, and we grab, for example, this repeat block,

71
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,480
and you see it has a number there, it also has this slot.

72
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,160
This is a slot that we can put other blocks into.

73
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,480
So I can take these two blocks and put them in here.

74
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,600
And you see that it sort of snaps around it.

75
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,840
This particular type of control block is called a C-shaped block,

76
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,440
and that's because it kind of looks like a C that you can put things into.

77
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,400
Let's give it a shot.

78
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,280
Let's use this repeat block, and we're going to draw our circle.

79
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,680
Without having to repeat these blocks 360 times.

80
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,120
Okay, so I'm going to take this block here,

81
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,880
and I'm going to type in 360. It's the number of times I want to repeat.

82
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,840
I'm going to put the pen down before I get started, and then I'll take the pen up.

83
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,640
And just to show that there's no magic behind the scenes,

84
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:25,840
let's get a clear block here so it starts fresh, and let's give it a try.

85
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,440
All right, here we go.

86
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,000
We can see a nice circle coming to existence.

87
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,000
And it stops when it completes the loop.

88
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,440
There you go. That's what we call a control block that makes it possible for us

89
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,800
to do complicated calculations or computations

90
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,920
without actually having to develop a huge stack of blocks.

91
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,520
We actually did it in just a few.

92
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,440
So this is one way to draw a circle,

93
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,480
but there is a certain downside to this particular technique.

94
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,880
You see that the circle is off-center.

95
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,840
It's not really in the center.

96
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,320
It started at the center, and then it kind of looped below,

97
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,240
and then it comes back up to the top.

98
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,080
So if we're going to use this technique,

99
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,080
we're going to have to do some interesting calculations

100
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,960
to figure out where we are going to put the center

101
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,200
whenever we run this set of blocks.

102
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,720
It might be easier to actually just start the calculation at the center,

103
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,520
and then we can say, here's where we want the circle to be,

104
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,240
and we can also define the radius.

105
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,520
Let's try a different technique.

106
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,160
I'm going to take these blocks and just throw them off to the side.

107
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,480
And then I'm going to start again with,

108
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,960
let's just take the pin down and pin up.

109
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,520
We know we need those, and the clear.

110
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,720
We're going to go to control, and I'm going to grab from here,

111
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,840
let's take a look, this repeat 10.

112
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,440
So that's the same as the last time.

113
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,320
But what we're going to do this time in motion,

114
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,800
we're going to use that go to 0, 0.

115
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,480
This is going to define where the particular circle starts.

116
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,760
That'll be the center of the circle.

117
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:56,400
And then this will help us define the radius, move 10 steps.

118
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,200
In this case, just to make it a little bit bigger, I'm going to say 50 steps.

119
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And then we're going to turn a degree right here.

120
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,800
Now, in order for this to work,

121
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,440
well, let's try it this way first, and I'll talk it through.

122
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,600
So I'll put the pin down here, the pin up there.

123
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,400
Let's put the clear on top to make sure everything is cleared,

124
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,280
and let's give it a shot.

125
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,240
That's not quite what we expected.

126
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:24,880
Why is that?

127
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,840
I forgot to change the 10 to 360.

128
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,400
Let's do that.

129
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,160
All right, again.

130
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,600
So that's making a nice circle.

131
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,160
But the difference here is that circle's filled in,

132
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,840
and that may be an effect that you want.

133
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,880
But if you just want to draw the same lines,

134
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,960
we're going to have to do a little bit of extra work.

135
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,000
Now, think about this.

136
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,520
Every time that this runs, it goes to 0, 0,

137
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,000
and then it moves 10, or in this case, I think we set it to 50,

138
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,360
50 steps from that direction that it's pointing,

139
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,760
and that's going to make the circumference of the circle.

140
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,280
And then we turn one degree,

141
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,560
and then it makes that same route again and again and again

142
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,080
until it makes it 360 times,

143
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,920
which is why the lines are filling the interior of the circle.

144
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,000
If we wanted to just simply sketch out the circumference,

145
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,160
then we're going to have to take the pin

146
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,760
and do a little bit more work here.

147
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,200
So let's say we still want it to be 50 steps.

148
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,760
So we're going to take 49.

149
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,600
I'm going to grab this over here again and pull in move 10 steps.

150
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,600
Then we're going to take the pin down and the pin up

151
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,720
and put it on one side or the other of this last piece.

152
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,920
I'm just going to change it to 1.

153
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,240
So now we've got move 49 steps,

154
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,520
but you see we also here have move 1 step.

155
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,560
And so when I put this back in right there,

156
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,320
let's get it clear.

157
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,080
Let's try it out.

158
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,840
You see it makes that trip up without tracing its steps

159
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,080
until that very last step,

160
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,480
in which case then it marks it on the screen.

161
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,960
So that actually now is just marking out the circumference.

162
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,200
So it's very similar to the way that we did it before,

163
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,640
but the difference is we can easily change the starting place

164
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,400
by just changing our x and y values.

165
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:19,200
So here let's start at 50 and you see it moves over there.

166
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,600
And we can also, of course, change the radius of the circle

167
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,440
by simply changing this number in here.

168
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,800
So now we're going to move 90 steps

169
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,120
or we'll try 89 to keep it an even number.

170
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,920
Well, not that big.

171
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,840
There we go.

172
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,400
Should we try it?

173
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,080
Oh, I think I still have it too big.

174
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:38,880
Let's try that again.

175
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,040
89.

176
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,160
There we go.

177
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,160
And we need to show, bring it back.

178
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,680
Should actually go back to the center anyway.

179
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:49,920
There we go.

180
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,440
So a slightly bigger circle.

181
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,560
Using this technique, we can move the circle around the screen,

182
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,360
selecting the center and the radius with greater ease.

183
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,600
If we want to make this set of blocks fancier,

184
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,000
we can also add another control block.

185
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,920
This is called a hat block.

186
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,120
Let's point it out right here.

187
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,840
So I'm going to go to control.

188
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,120
And these are the hat blocks.

189
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,320
They kind of look like a hat if you use your imagination.

190
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,520
So I'm going to bring this one over here.

191
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,080
It says, when green flag clicked.

192
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,160
And you'll note here that by putting that on top,

193
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,880
because it's sitting on the top of the other blocks,

194
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,480
I can kick off the sequence simply by clicking on this green flag here.

195
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,320
So I don't have to click on the set of blocks itself.

196
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,520
There you go.

197
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:40,000
That's a more elegant way to starting a computation or a program.

198
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And sometimes you actually need it, because you may have multiple sets of blocks,

199
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,800
and it's not clear to the user or even to yourself which set of blocks starts first.

200
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,520
So you use the green flag as click block to identify the point of entry into your program.

201
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,160
To return to our literary metaphor,

202
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,960
these hat blocks signal start reading on this page and then go from there.

203
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,960
OK, we've covered a number of concepts and techniques in this video.

204
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,920
We learned how to draw a circle in two different ways.

205
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,400
We gained insight into the D-R-Y principle.

206
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,640
And I introduced the concept of flow of control and control structures,

207
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,040
along with two kinds of control blocks, C-shaped blocks and hat blocks.

208
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,920
So that's enough for a single video.

209
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,280
In our next video, we'll put these techniques to use

210
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:30,560
by writing a program to create a pointillist painting a la Georges Seurat.

211
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,720
So look forward to seeing you next time.

212
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:42,240
Thanks for joining me.
