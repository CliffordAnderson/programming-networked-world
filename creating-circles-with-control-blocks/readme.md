# Introduction to Drawing Circles with NetsBlox

Welcome back, everyone! In today's lesson, we will learn how to draw a circle with our turtle in NetsBlox. We'll explore two different ways of drawing a circle and move on to some essential programming concepts like *the DRY principle* and *flow of control*. Along the way, we will also be introduced to *control structures* and *control blocks* - two crucial concepts in programming. 

In our first method of drawing a circle, we will use a *C-shaped block* from the control blocks section to achieve this without duplicating our motion blocks 360 times. This method follows the *DRY (Do Not Repeat Yourself) principle* and allows us to draw the circle efficiently. However, the circle we create with this method might be off-center, and we may need to perform some calculations to adjust its position.

For our second method, we will use our motion blocks more effectively to define the center and radius of the circle with ease. We'll move the pin down, draw a line, and move the pin back up to create a sketch of the circle's circumference. Moreover, we can adjust the x and y values to move the circle around the screen.

### Key takeaways from this lesson:
- There are multiple techniques to draw a circle with blocks in NetsBlocks.
- The DRY principle helps create efficient a program by reducing repetition.
- Flow of control and control structures are essential principles in programming.
- Control blocks can make programs easier to manage and read.
- C-shaped blocks and hat blocks are two types of control blocks used in NetsBlox.
