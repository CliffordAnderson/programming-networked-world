# Introduction to Mapping in Programming for Network World

Welcome to Programming for Network World! In today's lesson, we will explore the topic of *mapping*. Maps are used in various applications, like phones and cars, to guide us from point A to point B. In this course, we will learn how to integrate maps within your NetFlux programs, locate points of interest on the map, and design a program to perform *geolocation* based on a given address.

To start, we will be using *Google Maps* as an RPC (Remote Procedure Call) service within NetsBlox. We will input coordinates (latitude and longitude) to locate a specific point on the map, as well as determine map width, height, and zoom settings. Additionally, we will use built-in NetsBlox to determine personal latitude and longitude data using geospatial lookup on your browser.

For our exercise, we will create a program that allows users to input the name of a college and display its location on the map. To do this, we will use the *geolocation* RPC to extract coordinate locations based on the college's address. Next, we will store the latitude and longitude information in variables and input them into our *Google Maps* RPC to display the college location on the map.

## Key takeaways from this lesson:

- Maps can be integrated within your NetFlux programs to locate points of interest on the map.
- Google Maps can be used as an RPC service within NetsBlox.
- Latitude and longitude coordinates are essential for locating points on the map.
- Geolocation can be used to extract coordinate locations based on an address or place name.
- Coordinates can be inputted into Google Maps RPC to display locations on the map.
