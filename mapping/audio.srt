00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
Hi.

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,860
Welcome back to Programming for Network World.

3
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,340
Today's topic is mapping.

4
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,580
So we use maps all the time in our daily life.

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,100
We have them on our phones, and we use them in our cars

6
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,100
to guide us from point to point.

7
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:17,060
And you can also use maps within your NetFlux program.

8
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,740
So today, we're going to learn how to bring up a map

9
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,660
and to locate various topics or places of interest

10
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,860
in the world on those maps.

11
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,660
Ready to get mapping?

12
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:29,420
Let's get started.

13
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:41,500
OK, so like any other service in NetsBlox, mapping is an RPC.

14
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,540
So if we go over to our Network tab

15
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:51,340
and we click on the Call block here, we can drop down

16
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:56,420
and we can see that there is a entry for Google Maps.

17
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,060
And if we look at what's available here,

18
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,780
there's lots of choices.

19
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,420
We'll just try GitMap for now.

20
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,620
And you can see, we'll move Ada over a little bit.

21
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,980
You can see that there are slots for latitude, longitude,

22
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,660
width, height, and zoom.

23
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,100
So latitude and longitude allow us

24
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:20,300
to find the coordinate location of any place on a map

25
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,500
projection.

26
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,740
So that is really important information

27
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,660
about where to locate items in maps.

28
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,660
We'll get to width, height, and zoom in a moment.

29
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,300
But how do we know our latitude and longitude?

30
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,020
Well, we could look it up online.

31
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,320
But fortunately, there's also a block

32
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,460
for that within NetsBlox.

33
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:37,580
We'll go down here.

34
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,620
And you'll see here that there is

35
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:45,020
My Latitude and My Longitude.

36
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,660
Now, when I click on My Latitude,

37
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:50,300
if you have an enabled geospatial lookup

38
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,360
within your browser, you may get this pop-up.

39
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,640
And you just want to say Allow.

40
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,560
So we're going to allow that.

41
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,440
And now, the next time I click on it,

42
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,160
it should come back with a number.

43
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,440
So that represents My Latitude.

44
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,360
And the same thing here for My Longitude.

45
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,480
Now, the easy thing to do is just

46
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,280
to drop it into the slots that correspond to that.

47
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,560
And we're halfway there.

48
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,000
And the width and the height of the map

49
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,960
actually have to do with the width and height of our stage.

50
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,160
So we can also get that information right here,

51
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,800
Stage Height and Stage Width.

52
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,440
Of course, you can just type these in as numbers as well.

53
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,160
But this just makes it easier so that your map will adjust

54
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,200
as the size of the stage adjusts.

55
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,520
So here, we see that Stage Height is 360.

56
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,320
And the Stage Width, oops, I put it in the wrong place.

57
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,520
Stage Height, there we go.

58
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:49,520
Stage Width, we didn't check to see what the Stage Width was.

59
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,200
It was 480.

60
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,560
And let's do a default zoom of, say, 9.

61
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,880
Now, if we click that, you'll see that it

62
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,320
will go out to get a map.

63
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,000
But we have that same issue we've seen in other RPCs.

64
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,800
It's a very small map.

65
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,760
And that's because, as you know, in order

66
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,040
to make this appear on the stage,

67
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,080
we need to go to the Looks palette

68
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,560
and say Switch to Costume.

69
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,800
So now we can say Switch to Costume,

70
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,960
bring this down here, and click on this.

71
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,240
480 will disappear, and a map will appear in its place.

72
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,320
And this shows you where I am right now,

73
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,600
recording this in Nashville, Tennessee.

74
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,040
But oftentimes, in your programs,

75
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,240
you don't want to just show where you are now.

76
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,720
You often want to look up where you might like

77
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,920
to be or show other places.

78
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,680
So let's design a program to do what's called geolocation.

79
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,600
We're going to pass in an address.

80
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,560
Then we're going to get the coordinate location

81
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,560
of that address.

82
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,600
And then we're going to pass that information

83
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,720
into our mapping RPC and display that place on the map.

84
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,160
And just to make this more fun, let's

85
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,200
imagine that you're going on a college tour.

86
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,280
You're thinking about what college

87
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,640
you might like to attend.

88
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,400
And you want to see where these places are on a map.

89
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,480
So we're going to make this possible for us

90
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,560
to type in the name of a college, get its location,

91
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,960
and then show where it is on the map.

92
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:18,480
OK, so to do that, let's start off with sensing.

93
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,480
And we'll ask a question here.

94
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,520
So we'll say, ask.

95
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:31,160
And we'll bring it up here and say, what college

96
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,480
are we thinking about?

97
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,920
How about that?

98
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,920
It's a question.

99
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,360
And you know that when you ask a question like that

100
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,560
with the ask block, that the answer is captured here

101
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,200
in this answer block.

102
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,640
Now, we need to use a different RPC to get those coordinates.

103
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,320
And that is also built in.

104
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,080
But it's not in the same RPC that we've been using.

105
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,240
So let's go over here to get our call block again.

106
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,640
Let's drop it down.

107
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,240
And let's look at what's possible here.

108
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,600
And we see, for example, right above Google Maps,

109
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,660
very convenient, is geolocation.

110
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,920
And when we drop down geolocation,

111
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,360
we can get a lot of different types of information

112
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,040
we can pass in.

113
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:15,160
Basically, we could pass in a street address, a city name.

114
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,880
We can see what's nearby.

115
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,360
We can ask about different countries.

116
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,600
So there's lots of things you can do here.

117
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,320
We're just going to use this geolocate.

118
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,780
And it asks for an address.

119
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,280
Now, you might think you have to give

120
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,820
like the street address of colleges

121
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,520
and go to their website and look that up.

122
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,480
But actually, it will figure this out for you.

123
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,200
This is the nice thing about this block.

124
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,740
For the most part, you can just type

125
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,720
in the name of what you're interested in.

126
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,160
And it will try to geolocate it for you.

127
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,840
So I might try, for example, Vanderbilt University

128
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,120
and try this out.

129
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,920
Let's see.

130
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:53,560
And now I get a list of lists, latitude and longitude.

131
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,320
So OK, we know when we get information back

132
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,920
in that form of a list of lists, we've done this before,

133
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,120
that we need to go over and start

134
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,460
extracting that information.

135
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,320
Because in order to pass in latitude and longitude,

136
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,720
we need to get those separately.

137
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,560
So let's do that.

138
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,600
And the easiest way to do that, perhaps, is to get a variable.

139
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:22,320
And we'll call this our place or maybe our college or maybe,

140
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,000
yeah, our college is fine.

141
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,820
So we'll call it our college.

142
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:30,480
And then here, we're going to call.

143
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:37,400
We'll have a block where we set that variable here.

144
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:43,000
And we're going to set our college

145
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,800
to the value of this RPC.

146
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,040
But we're going to use that answer variable here

147
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,960
to say what college we're looking for.

148
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,760
OK, so that's good.

149
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,600
That'll capture that information for our college.

150
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,760
Now, in order to be able to pass it

151
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,880
in as my latitude and my longitude,

152
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,880
we'll take that out because that always shows me

153
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,000
where I am right now.

154
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,600
And we want to show where I'd like

155
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,880
to be when I'm thinking about this college.

156
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,760
So here, we're going to take this item 1 of

157
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:16,760
and take another one here and do this here.

158
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:21,840
Same thing there, but we'll do this one will be item 2.

159
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,640
And we might need to look at this again just

160
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,920
to kind of get a sense of.

161
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,880
I'll copy this here, duplicate it,

162
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,460
just so you have a sense of what we're

163
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,200
trying to identify in this.

164
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,200
So again, type in, just for the sake of exercise here,

165
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,960
Vanderbilt University.

166
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,080
And when I click on it, OK, latitude and longitude.

167
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,080
So I need to get this number and this number.

168
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,760
So that's going to be here item 1.

169
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:57,400
It's going to be item 2 of item 1 and item 2 of item 2,

170
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:04,640
because that is item 1, but item 2 of item 1.

171
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,360
And this is item 2 and item 2 of item 2.

172
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,160
So let's just test it out with one of these

173
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,320
and we'll see if we get the right information here.

174
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,320
There we go, 36.

175
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,560
That's right.

176
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,040
And here, we should get negative 86.

177
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,000
That's right.

178
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,540
So that's the way that we need to be

179
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:24,720
able to capture that information coming out of our college.

180
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,120
So we'll put this down here for latitude.

181
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,080
This is the tricky one.

182
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,780
Which is latitude and which is longitude?

183
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,360
Well, we'll find out in a minute.

184
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,520
And here we go.

185
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,080
And we'll get these off the stage

186
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,440
because we don't need them any longer.

187
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,880
All right.

188
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,080
And we'll duplicate this variable here.

189
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,800
We'll just pull it out.

190
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,720
Oops.

191
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,880
And drop it in here and drop it in here.

192
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,280
Now, let's just try Vanderbilt just

193
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,080
to see if we've got this right.

194
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,880
So it should ask me where I'd like to go,

195
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,120
what college am I thinking of.

196
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,000
Let's say Vanderbilt University.

197
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,720
Click on that.

198
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:13,080
And we don't seem to have gotten there.

199
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,640
Oh, of course we did because that's where we are.

200
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,720
Let's try a different one.

201
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,680
That's not too helpful.

202
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,800
So maybe it's working, but let's try it again.

203
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,280
Let's try Harvard University.

204
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,880
Yeah, it's working.

205
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,520
OK.

206
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,760
And let's try Michigan State just

207
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,800
to make sure everything is working fine here.

208
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:41,120
So Michigan State University.

209
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,200
There we go, East Lansing, Michigan.

210
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,080
OK, so it's definitely working.

211
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,880
We've got our latitude and longitude

212
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,360
in the right places.

213
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,920
You can adjust the zoom.

214
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,680
So if you want to get a little bit closer,

215
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,560
you could type in, for example, 11.

216
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,080
We can just try this again.

217
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,840
So let's try my alma mater, Kenyon College.

218
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,040
And there you go.

219
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,240
So you can get a little bit closer even still

220
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,000
if you type in higher numbers, you'll get greater zoom.

221
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,680
Obviously, if you have lower numbers,

222
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,960
you'll pull back more and get more of the encompassing area.

223
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,480
OK, so that, I think, is where we'll leave it for now.

224
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,000
We're going to continue this exercise of learning

225
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,720
to display information on maps in our next videos.

226
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,360
But that's a short introduction to how to use the map

227
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,320
and how to look up information using geolocation

228
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,040
and then to bring us to that point on a map.

229
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,720
So thanks, everyone, for joining me.

230
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,080
And I'll see you in the next video.
