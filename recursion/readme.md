# Introduction to Recursion

Welcome back to *Programming for a Network World*. In this lesson, we will delve into the fascinating topic of *recursion*. We will build a project that computes factorials using two different programming styles: looping and recursion. Through these examples, we will illustrate that recursion may sometimes be more efficient and easier to program.

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself as part of its solution. When implementing recursion, it is essential to ensure that it has two cases: the *base case* and the *recursive case*. The base case controls when the recursion ends, while the recursive case is when the function calls itself again, tending towards the base case.

In this lesson, we created two functions to compute factorials: one using a traditional loop and another using recursion. We demonstrated that, depending on the context, recursion can sometimes produce faster results than using loops. However, it's important to keep in mind that both approaches can be suitable, depending on the specific programming environment and problem at hand.

## Key takeaways from this lesson

1. Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself as part of its solution.
2. To implement recursion, ensure the function has two cases: the base case, and the recursive case.
3. The base case controls when recursion ends, while the function calls itself again in the recursive case.
4. Recursion can sometimes be more efficient and easier to program than using loops, depending on the context and problem.
5. Whether using recursion or loops, both approaches can generally be transformed into each other and applied effectively in various programming environments.
