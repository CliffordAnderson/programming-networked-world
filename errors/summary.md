# Errors

Hi everyone, in the upcoming video, we'll be discussing the important topic of *debugging*. We'll create a simple program to perform division and calculate the quotient and remainder. However, we'll intentionally introduce errors into the program and then demonstrate how to use some of the built-in debugging tools in NetBlocks to identify and correct these errors. Get ready to squash some bugs!

In the video, we'll explore the *visible stepping* tool that allows us to watch the sequence of steps in our program, helping us identify where errors occur. We'll also introduce the concept of a *breakpoint* using the *pause all* block, which pauses the program execution and enables us to inspect the values of variables at a specific point in time. This will be invaluable in identifying and solving issues related to variable types and values.

Finally, we'll address the potential issues arising from invalid user input and demonstrate how to use conditional statements to prevent errors such as division by zero. We'll also show how to ensure that the input parameters are of the correct type by defining them as numbers. By the end of the video, you'll have a better understanding of debugging and error handling techniques in programming.
