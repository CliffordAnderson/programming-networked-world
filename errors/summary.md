Hi everyone, welcome back to Programming for a Networked World. In
today\'s session, we discussed **debugging** and how to identify and fix
errors in our programs. We started by creating a simple program in
NetBlocks that takes two numbers as inputs and returns their
**quotient** and **remainder** after division. Along the way, we
introduced some errors to demonstrate the debugging process. We explored
the use of **visible stepping** and **break points** to help us narrow
down the source of errors and inspect the state of variables.

We found that our program had a bug related to the use of lists. To
solve this, we created a **watcher** for our variables and realized that
one of them should have been initialized as a list instead of an
integer. Fixing this issue resolved the error. We also discussed
handling other potential errors, such as dividing by zero and input
validation to ensure the parameters received are numbers. To handle
these, we used **if statements** and provided appropriate error messages
for users.

In conclusion, debugging is an essential skill in programming, and
various tools can help you identify and fix errors. There is no single
way to address errors, and it\'s crucial to think about the inputs your
program receives and how to handle different scenarios. Thanks for
joining us today, and we look forward to covering more topics in our
next video.
