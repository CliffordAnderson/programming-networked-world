00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,720
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,280
Welcome back to Programming for a Network World.

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,600
Today, we're going to continue our exercise with mapping.

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,100
We're going to explore now how to put a map on the stage,

5
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,720
and then from there, how to display the weather

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,960
condition for any part of the country you're interested in.

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,880
All right, so ready to find some icons to display the weather?

8
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:20,600
Let's get going.

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:30,200
So let's get started by just creating a map again

10
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,160
like we did before.

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,600
So I'm going to go over to our RPC here under Network,

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,760
and I'm going to bring out this call block.

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,640
I'm going to switch it down to Google Maps,

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,240
and I'm going to then get map.

15
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,200
And let's do the latitude and longitude

16
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,880
just for where I am again.

17
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,080
So as you remember, the way that we do that,

18
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:55,320
we can go over here to Sensing, and we can drop down

19
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:03,600
to My Latitude, drop it in here, My Longitude over here,

20
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,640
then the Height there.

21
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,240
Let's try that again.

22
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:16,760
The Height there, and the Width, the Stage.

23
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,640
There we go.

24
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,360
This one is over here, so we'll just throw it away.

25
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,120
And we'll set a zoom of, let's just say, 11.

26
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,040
Get some of the surrounding area.

27
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,480
Now, remember, we need to go over to Looks,

28
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:35,120
switch to Costume, and we're going to drop this in there.

29
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,160
OK, so now I'm just going to give a little more space here.

30
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,440
OK, let's try this out.

31
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,640
And there's our map.

32
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,400
If I went a little bit too quickly there,

33
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,880
go back and review the other video,

34
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,840
because that's where we covered how to create these maps.

35
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,840
OK, so now that we've got a map, our goal today

36
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,400
is for us to be able to click on any part of this map

37
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,240
and then get an icon representing

38
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,840
the current weather conditions in that part of the map.

39
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,680
So if you think about what we need to do,

40
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,160
we need to trap a position using our xy-coordinate

41
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,900
of the stage.

42
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:14,400
And then we need to convert that xy-coordinate

43
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,840
into a latitude and longitude that we

44
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,360
can pass to some kind of weather RPC.

45
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,520
Hopefully, that exists.

46
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,400
It actually does in Nets Blocks.

47
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,320
And then we'll find an icon to represent the weather.

48
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,440
If that sounds complicated, it might

49
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,760
be using other programming languages.

50
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,740
But fortunately, there are tools within Nets Blocks

51
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,320
to make that process much easier.

52
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:43,960
So let's begin by thinking about how to get the xy-coordinates.

53
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:51,000
So let's try going to our RPCs to see if there's

54
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,640
anything that can help us here.

55
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,760
So I'm going to go down here.

56
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,840
And let's go back to Google Maps.

57
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,120
All right.

58
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,400
And let's look at our list of options again.

59
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,920
Now, when you look at the list of options, you see here,

60
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,960
get latitude from y and get longitude from x.

61
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,920
So that's exactly what we need.

62
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,160
We need to be able to click on an xy position

63
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,720
and then translate that into the latitude and longitude

64
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,720
of the map that we're looking at.

65
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,360
So let's just go ahead and try that out.

66
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,400
We're going to get latitude from x or latitude from y.

67
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,480
And I'll duplicate this here.

68
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,480
And get longitude from x.

69
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,440
So here is their x and y positions.

70
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,120
Now, we can give the information about where our x and y

71
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,040
is by going to the sensing block here

72
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,000
and saying mouse x and mouse y.

73
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,440
So let's just say mouse x and mouse y.

74
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,480
Now, we can click on it.

75
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,560
Oops.

76
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,520
Here.

77
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,400
Let's try that.

78
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,760
There we go.

79
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,000
And you see that it is now giving us those positions.

80
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,640
They're not the positions that we want,

81
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,560
because it's trapping where our mouse is actually

82
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,040
in the scripting area rather than on the stage.

83
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,760
But we'll get to that in a second.

84
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,520
So that's great.

85
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,680
That's actually the information that we need to pass

86
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,360
in to get our weather icon.

87
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,960
But how do we get the icon itself?

88
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:17,680
So let's go back to look at our list of RPCs here.

89
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,280
I'll bring this over again.

90
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,200
And let's drop this down.

91
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,520
And there's a section called Science here

92
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,520
that has a lot of information that

93
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,960
has to do with various different types of measurements,

94
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,080
historical trends.

95
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,840
We've looked at these before when we were doing our chart

96
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,720
RPC.

97
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,360
But if you look down here, you see under Science,

98
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,920
you also see Weather.

99
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,560
And so if we look now at what's possible for weather,

100
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,100
we see we've got a number of options.

101
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,120
We've got a description, humidity icon, temperature,

102
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,400
wind angle, speed.

103
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,160
So let's go for Icon.

104
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,960
And you see it does come with a latitude and longitude.

105
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,080
So now we can drop these blocks in here.

106
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,960
This is the latitude.

107
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,520
So let's drop that in there.

108
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,120
And this is the longitude.

109
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,320
And if we click on it, we get a cloudy icon.

110
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,440
Now, it's a little bit hard to tell what is cloudy,

111
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,880
because, again, we're trapping a XY position that's

112
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,680
on the stage, on the scripting area, excuse me,

113
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,000
rather than the stage.

114
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,680
And so we actually need to now look

115
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,240
to see where on the map that's on the stage

116
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,280
we can get a weather icon.

117
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,560
So let's think about how to do that.

118
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,200
Here, I think it's a little bit tricky.

119
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,680
We need to think about when you're

120
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,360
interacting with this map, a user will be on the map

121
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,880
and then click at some point in the map like this.

122
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,280
And then we want to trap that click,

123
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,600
then pass in the XY position of the place

124
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,600
that the person clicked on the map.

125
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,200
And then we want to translate that

126
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,760
into the corresponding icon for the current weather

127
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,280
conditions.

128
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,800
So I think the best way to do this

129
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,640
is to split between we're working right now

130
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,160
on the scripting area, but I think

131
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,360
we should split our project into using a stage and a sprite.

132
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,920
And so what I'm going to do is take this

133
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:09,600
that we've done here, this initial mapping setup,

134
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,640
and I'm going to move it over to the stage.

135
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,400
So I can just move it like this.

136
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,960
And it actually duplicates.

137
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,700
You can see that I still got a copy here,

138
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,520
but I'm going to throw that away.

139
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,320
And that's because if I go to the stage,

140
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,560
you'll see now that I've got a copy there.

141
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,080
So that's good.

142
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,360
And let's go up here and just kind of get

143
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,880
a when green flag clicked.

144
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,760
So we'll do that over here.

145
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,320
There we go, to start the project.

146
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,560
And now we want to trap here.

147
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,400
Anyone who clicks on the stage, we

148
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,960
want to kind of trap that event.

149
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,920
So you know when we're talking about events

150
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,680
that one way to capture them is to use a broadcast block.

151
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,560
So we're going to do this.

152
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,040
We're going to go over to when I am clicked.

153
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,400
So this is an event.

154
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,080
And then we're going to broadcast

155
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,440
that that event has occurred.

156
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,480
That way, we'll be able to capture that event

157
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:02,200
in our sprite, which is where we'll do our icons for the weather

158
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,360
conditions.

159
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,120
OK, so we'll just make this a very simple broadcast.

160
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,320
So I'll do that here.

161
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,800
And I'm going to say new.

162
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:17,840
And let's just call it look up weather, say.

163
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,920
So when this is clicked, it will look up the weather.

164
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,120
But we have nothing yet that will handle that broadcast.

165
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,880
So there's nothing here in our sprite

166
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,680
that will actually handle that.

167
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,640
So now we need to think, OK, when I receive this message,

168
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,280
what do I do?

169
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,400
So first of all, let's just start off with when I receive.

170
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,760
And if we drop down here, we can say look up weather.

171
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,160
So when I receive look up weather,

172
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,920
then I need to do something.

173
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:50,120
Now, we need to move to the xy position where the mouse is.

174
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,440
So let's do that.

175
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,120
Let's go to motion.

176
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,600
And we'll move to here.

177
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:03,520
Go to the xy position of the mouse.

178
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,800
So let's do that here.

179
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,960
Let's see, xy, there we go.

180
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:18,480
Mouse x and mouse y.

181
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,320
And then we're going to display the weather.

182
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,560
So same way that we need to get it onto the stage,

183
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,180
we're going to switch to that costume.

184
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:31,220
But this is now the sprites costume, not the stage.

185
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,500
And so let's do that.

186
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,060
We're going to go to looks.

187
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,860
Switch to costume here.

188
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,940
We're going to drop this into there.

189
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,780
Now, we've got our mouse x and mouse y.

190
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:48,580
So that's good.

191
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:51,340
OK, now the only thing that we need to do

192
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:55,820
is to draw that icon on this part of the stage.

193
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,820
The easiest way to do that is to use some

194
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,220
of the tools that come with Pen.

195
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:05,380
So here, we're going to go to stamp.

196
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:12,580
And all right, we'll stamp that particular icon

197
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,780
at that position on the stage.

198
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:18,180
So let's give it an initial try and see how it works.

199
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,500
So we start it.

200
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,620
I'm going to click here.

201
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,380
Let's see, are we handling the event yet?

202
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,820
OK, there we go.

203
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,300
Let's see.

204
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:36,500
Now, click there, click there, click there.

205
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,620
OK, so that's not working yet.

206
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:47,620
Let's go and see what is going on with our program here.

207
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:52,620
OK, when I receive lookup weather, go to X, Y, Z.

208
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:57,300
OK, when I receive lookup weather, go to X, Y position,

209
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,500
switch to costume.

210
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,220
Let's just make sure this is working here.

211
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,220
Yep, that looks good.

212
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:12,140
And then stamp, so there we go.

213
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:17,060
OK, so let me start this from scratch.

214
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,820
Now, you notice when I start from scratch,

215
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:22,300
I'm still leaving those icons on the stage.

216
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,140
So we actually want to remove them whenever

217
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,300
we hit the green flag click.

218
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,460
So let's do a little bit of setup here.

219
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:32,620
So let's go over to the stage here.

220
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,180
And when we first start up, we're

221
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:37,140
just going to hit Clear, OK?

222
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:40,300
So here, we'll just say, when green flag is clicked,

223
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,540
clear the stage, so just get rid of any of the icons

224
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,220
that had been there before.

225
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,060
And then we'll start from scratch.

226
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,940
And the other thing is, I think we want to also, well,

227
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,060
let's try it.

228
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,380
OK, so we're going to start it.

229
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,460
And there we go.

230
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,820
We're able to click and see the conditions around us.

231
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,820
But there's one problem.

232
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,420
You notice when we started here, we still

233
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,380
had one icon that was left over.

234
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:11,780
And that's because the sprite is still showing on the stage.

235
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,100
So one way to do that is to set it up

236
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,220
so that when we run this, we show the sprite,

237
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,380
and then we hide the sprite.

238
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,260
So let's do that here.

239
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:24,260
And let's go over to Show and to Hide.

240
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:28,500
And this will mean that we first show the sprite, we stamp,

241
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,700
and that leaves this permanent imprint of where

242
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,900
the sprite is on the stage.

243
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,020
And then we hide the sprite again

244
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,220
so we don't have that problem of a lingering weather

245
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:42,220
condition that persists past the beginning of the program.

246
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:45,020
All right, so let's try that one more time.

247
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:48,420
Can I click Stop, and then we'll hit Run.

248
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,580
And this first time, I guess it's still left there.

249
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:54,260
So let's try it again now because it should be hidden.

250
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,420
So I'm going to click this, Run.

251
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,660
You see things are gone now.

252
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,380
The sprites aren't showing because we've

253
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,340
hidden them right here.

254
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,960
And now we can test this out again.

255
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,380
So this should be the full program.

256
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,780
Let's just bring this out all the way.

257
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,940
And let's see how things are in Nashville today.

258
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:14,140
So downtown Nashville is cloudy.

259
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:17,260
Up by Vanderbilt, probably also cloudy.

260
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,340
Yep.

261
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:21,180
We could set our initial starting point.

262
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,140
Let's just go to the stage here, and let's

263
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,260
zoom out a little bit more.

264
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:28,140
Let's try, like, I don't know.

265
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,740
How about five?

266
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,820
And we'll click on that.

267
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,060
We'll get the new map.

268
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,020
Give it a second for the map to show.

269
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:38,500
There we go.

270
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,280
Now we're getting a much broader geographic area.

271
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,480
So let's try the same thing.

272
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,940
We'll look at various cities around.

273
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,740
So Nashville, again, should be cloudy.

274
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:49,380
But how is Indianapolis?

275
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,620
Partly cloudy, I guess, is what that means.

276
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,140
Washington, DC, cloudy at once.

277
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,540
Cloudy day all around.

278
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,540
How about Georgia?

279
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,180
Same thing.

280
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,860
How about Louisiana?

281
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,540
Wow, same thing.

282
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:04,860
All right, it's sunny as you head out to the Midwest.

283
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,220
OK, so that's it for today.

284
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:10,940
So just to recap, what you saw was that we can create a map.

285
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:14,600
And then by trapping the interaction with the map,

286
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,400
where we clicked with our mouse XY coordinates,

287
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,280
we can translate that into latitude and longitude

288
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,060
and pass that to another RPC that then gives us

289
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,880
information about the weather conditions

290
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,920
in that particular region of the map.

291
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,560
We'll continue with mapping next time.

292
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,480
So I look forward to seeing you in our next video.
