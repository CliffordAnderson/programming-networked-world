# Mapping and Displaying Weather Conditions

Welcome back! In this lesson, we will learn how to create a map and display the weather condition for any part of the country that you're interested in. We'll utilize the RPCs within *NetsBlocks* to make this process as simple as possible. We'll begin by creating a map and obtaining the xy-coordinates for any chosen location.

In order to accomplish our goal, we will need to trap a position using the xy-coordinate of the stage, and then convert that position into a latitude and longitude that we can pass to a weather RPC, just like we did in the previous video. The process of displaying the weather involves adding blocks to allow users to interact with the map, trap their click events, then translate the click into the corresponding icon for the current weather conditions.

To make the project more streamlined, we will split our project into using a stage for the initial mapping setup and a sprite for handling the weather icons. Finally, we will utilize the *Pen* tools to draw the weather icon onto the stage.

## Key takeaways
- Putting a map on the stage and displaying the weather condition for any part of the country.
- Using RPCs within *NetsBlocks* to create the map and obtain xy-coordinates.
- Converting xy-coordinates into a latitude and longitude to pass to a weather RPC.
- Splitting the code between the stage for setting up the map and a sprite for displaying the weather icons.
- Utilizing the *Pen* tools to draw the weather icon on the stage.
