# Mapping and Displaying Weather Conditions

Welcome back to *Programming for a Network World*. In today's lesson, we will learn how to create a map and display the weather condition for any part of the country that you're interested in. We'll utilize the tools within *Nets Blocks* to make this process as simple as possible. We'll begin by creating a map and obtaining the xy-coordinates for any chosen location.

In order to accomplish our goal, we will need to trap a position using the xy-coordinate of the stage, and then convert that position into a latitude and longitude that we can pass to a weather RPC. The process of displaying the weather involves interacting with the map, trapping the click event, then translating the click into the corresponding icon for the current weather conditions.

To make the project more streamlined, we will split our project into using a stage for the initial mapping setup and a sprite for handling the weather icons. Finally, we will utilize the *Pen* tools to draw the weather icon onto the stage.

## Key takeaways from this lesson:
- Putting a map on the stage and displaying the weather condition for any part of the country.
- Using tools within *Nets Blocks* to create the map and obtain xy-coordinates.
- Converting xy-coordinates into a latitude and longitude to pass to a weather RPC.
- Splitting the project into using a stage for mapping setup and a sprite for handling the weather icons.
- Utilizing the *Pen* tools to draw the weather icon onto the stage.
