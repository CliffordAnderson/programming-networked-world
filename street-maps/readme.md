Welcome back to our class, Programming for a Network World. Today, we will be delving deeper into the concept of mapping, specifically focusing on Google Street View within Netsblocks. Google Street View, as you may already know, allows you to view images of various locations around the world. Our project for today will involve building a city explorer. We will create a list of cities, select a random city from this list, and display it in Netsblocks. This could potentially be the foundation for a game, such as a 'guess the city' game. To begin, we will revisit the RPC tab and bring out our usual call block. Here, you will notice an option for Google Street View. Upon expanding this, you will see several options including 'get info', 'get info from address', 'get view', 'get view from address', 'is available', and 'is available from address'. For our project, we will be using 'get view from address' and 'is available from address'. The aim is to input the name of a city along with a few additional pieces of information, and receive an image of that city in return. To test this out, we will use 'get view from address' and fill in the slots provided. For our first test, we will use Nashville as our city. We will then use the Sensing tab to get the height and width of the stage. The fields of view, heading, and pitch are specific to the Google Street Images RPC. For our purposes, we will fill these in with 90, 90, and 0 respectively. Upon running this, we should receive an image of Nashville. To explore other cities, we need to have their names. We could create our own list of city names, or we could use a pre-existing list. For this project, we will use a list from GitHub that contains hundreds, possibly thousands, of city names from a mapping service. To bring this data into Netsblocks, we will use the URL block under the Sensing tab. However, the data comes back as a large string in JSON format, which is not ideal for our purposes. To convert this data into a more usable format, we will use a library called HTTP under the Libraries tab. This library contains a tool called Listify, which will convert our string data into a list of lists format. We can then use this data to pull out the names of the cities for our project. Top five learning outcomes from the video: - Understanding how to use Google Street View within Netsblocks. - Learning how to build a city explorer by creating a list of cities and displaying a random city in Netsblocks. - Learning how to use the RPC tab and the different options available under Google Street View. - Understanding how to import data from an external source, such as GitHub, into Netsblocks. - Learning how to convert string data into a list of lists format using the HTTP library and the Listify tool.In this video, I will be demonstrating how to manipulate lists of data using the Map block. We will be working with a list of cities from around the world, and our goal is to extract only the names of the cities from this list. To do this, we will use the Map block to apply a function to each item in the list. This function will extract the second item from each sub-list, which corresponds to the city name. After applying the Map block, we will have a new list that contains only the names of the cities. Next, we will set up our environment for further exploration of this data. We will create two variables, 'city' and 'cities', to store our data. We will then use the 'when green flag is clicked' block to populate the 'cities' variable with our list of city names when the program starts. This is done to avoid repeatedly calling out to the long list of cities, which can slow down our program. Once our 'cities' variable is populated, we will start working on a function to display a random city from our list. We will use the 'when Space key pressed' block to trigger this function. In this function, we will set the 'city' variable to a random item from our 'cities' list. To do this, we will use the 'pick random' block, which generates a random number between two specified values. We will set these values to 1 and the length of our 'cities' list, ensuring that any city in our list can be selected. However, we encounter a problem when we try to display the selected city. Not every city in our list has imagery available on Google Street View, and our program does not handle these cases well. To solve this problem, we need to filter our list of cities to remove those that do not have available imagery. Unfortunately, we do not know which cities these are in advance, so we will need to query Google for this information. In the next part of the video, we will demonstrate how to use the RPC block under the Network category to query Google for this information. This will allow us to filter our list of cities and ensure that our program can successfully display a random city from around the world. Top five learning outcomes from the video: - How to use the Map block to manipulate lists of data. - How to create and populate variables in a program. - How to generate and use random numbers in a program. - How to handle cases where data may not be available or may cause errors in a program. - How to use the RPC block to query external sources for information.In this video, I introduce the concept of using Google Street View to verify the existence of a city. We use the function isAvailableFromAddress to check if a city exists. For instance, if we input 'Nashville' with the coordinates 90, 90, 0, it should return true. However, if we input a non-existent city like 'Porcupine', it should return false. The goal is to test if a randomly selected city exists and then display an image of the city from Google Street View. To achieve this, we need to start by querying the city's existence. We use a loop to iterate through cities until we find one for which Google confirms it has imagery. We use the repeatUntil block from our control structures, but we need to check for the Boolean flag after we've run the code rather than before. We use the iteration composition from the libraries and type L-O-L for loop. We now have a repeatUntil block that tests at the end of the loop for a condition. We then set a variable for the city so that we don't have to keep going through it again and again. We set the city to this variable and ask if the city is available. We repeat this operation of checking if the city is available. As soon as we get a true response, we pass on to the next block. We need to do a Boolean comparison here, so we test to see if the city's existence is true. We then replace 'Porcupine' with our city variable. Once we know that a city exists, we can move on. The loop will continue to look for cities randomly until it finds one that exists. Only then will we switch to the city's image. We keep the same city variable, which is why we didn't need to create a new one. We then populate our list again and hit the space key. We notice some cycling going on as it looks for a city. It finally finds a city it can pick after several attempts. To prevent the appearance of cycling, we can hide and show the variable. We show the variable at the end and hide it at the beginning. However, there's a bit of switching from the old variable name to the new variable name. We could probably fix this if we wanted to.

We have been working on a project that involves printing the name of a city on the screen. After some trial and error, we have successfully managed to get it working. This is a significant step in our exploration of mapping, as it demonstrates the practical application of the concepts we have been discussing. We then discussed how this concept could be taken further and developed into an interactive game. The game would involve the user guessing the name of the city being displayed. However, with a list of 126,000 cities, this could prove to be quite challenging. Therefore, we discussed potential ways to make the game more interesting and playable. One suggestion was to present the player with three city names at random, one of which would be the correct answer. This would allow the player to make an educated guess, rather than having to choose from the entire list of cities. This would make the game fairer and more engaging for the player. In conclusion, this video has provided a practical demonstration of mapping in Nest Blocks, and has explored how this concept can be applied to create an interactive game. We have also discussed potential ways to make the game more engaging and fair for the player. In our next video, we will continue our exploration of mapping in Nest Blocks. We will delve deeper into this concept and explore more complex applications. I look forward to continuing this journey with you.
