00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,500
Welcome back to Programming for a Network World.

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,760
Today, we're going to continue our exploration of mapping.

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,560
In particular, we're going to explore Google Street

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,400
View within Netsblocks.

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,080
So as you know, Google Street View

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,480
allows you to see images of locations in cities and places

8
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,960
around the world.

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,880
So ready to explore the world with Netsblocks?

10
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,680
Let's get started.

11
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:33,720
So today's project will be we're going to build a city

12
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,480
explorer.

13
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,720
We're going to take a list of cities,

14
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,720
and then we're going to take a random city

15
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,680
and then show it in Netsblocks.

16
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,920
So this could be the beginning of a game

17
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,120
that you would make, like a guess the city game.

18
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,780
So we'll set up the structure for that,

19
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,600
and then if you want to continue with it,

20
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,760
please feel free to do so.

21
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,720
All right, so how do we get started?

22
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,960
First, we're going to go over and explore the RPC tab again.

23
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,120
And we'll bring out our normal call block.

24
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,440
I'm going to drop this down, and you see here

25
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,320
that we have Google Street View.

26
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,360
Now, when I expand that and I look at the dropdown,

27
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,160
I see that we have a number of options.

28
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,280
Get info, get info from address, get view, get view from address

29
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,280
is available, is available from address.

30
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,920
Today, we're going to use the get view from address

31
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,520
and is available from address.

32
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,720
So the goal is we're going to pass in the name of a city,

33
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,640
we're going to pass in a few additional pieces

34
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,020
of information, and then we're going to get an image back

35
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,960
of that city, just some random image,

36
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,200
and then we'll leave it up to the viewer

37
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,040
to see if he or she can guess what that city is.

38
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,480
So now, let's just try to test this out to begin.

39
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,640
So we're going to get view from address,

40
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,880
and you see here that we've now got a bunch of slots to fill.

41
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,840
The first one we'll slot, the first slot

42
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,280
we'll fill, which is Nashville.

43
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,120
And then we'll do our normal thing

44
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:04,760
of going over to Sensing to get the height of the stage

45
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,200
and the width of the stage.

46
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,400
There we go.

47
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,080
Let's bring that over.

48
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,080
OK.

49
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,560
Now, field of view, heading, and pitch

50
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:19,120
are specific to the Google Street Images RPC.

51
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,800
And so if you look at this, you can click Help,

52
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,520
and it will give you some more detail

53
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,680
about what those particular parameters mean.

54
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,680
In this case, though, I'm just going

55
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:34,360
to fill this in with 90, 90, and 0.

56
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,280
And if you want to explore using different parameters,

57
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,760
feel free to do so.

58
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,800
So let's try that out.

59
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,340
We should get an image of Nashville.

60
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:41,920
There we did.

61
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,860
But as you know, we need to put this on the stage.

62
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,700
So let's go do that.

63
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,020
Under the Looks category, we'll switch to Costume.

64
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,460
I can bring this over if I can.

65
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,820
There we go.

66
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,740
And I'm going to drop that in here, switch the costume,

67
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:59,900
and then there is a random spot in Nashville.

68
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,780
Now, how do we explore other cities?

69
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,580
Well, we need to have the names of the city

70
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,540
if we want to look them up by name.

71
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,500
So in order to do that, we could develop our own list.

72
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,480
We could just type in a list of names.

73
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,640
Or even better, we could find a list

74
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,140
that someone else has put together.

75
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,300
So there is such a list.

76
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,500
And I've got it right here in this tab.

77
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:22,720
This is a list from GitHub of, I think, probably hundreds

78
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:29,900
or maybe even thousands of cities from a mapping service.

79
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,380
And so I'm going to use that.

80
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,060
But how do I bring that into Nest Blocks?

81
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,180
Well, there are a couple of ways.

82
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,480
And this is one of the things we'll be exploring today.

83
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,180
If you find data that is not packaged up as an RPC,

84
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,640
how do you get to it?

85
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,680
Under the Sensing tab here, you'll

86
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,640
see that there is a URL block.

87
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,560
So let's put that in here.

88
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,360
There we go.

89
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,720
So that's the link to the data on GitHub.

90
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,960
And if I click on this, you'll see

91
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,400
that it brings back that data.

92
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,520
And you can see that it's in the JSON format.

93
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,480
But the problem is it's just coming back as a giant string.

94
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,520
So what do we do here if this is the case,

95
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,560
if we just get data like this, but we actually

96
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,660
want to compute with it?

97
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,360
This won't work in Nest Blocks unless we

98
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,320
do some kind of hairy parsing.

99
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:15,040
So what we want to do, then, is go to a library that's up here.

100
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,340
And we're going to open this library under the Libraries

101
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,280
tab.

102
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,680
And we're going to put HTTP.

103
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,200
And it says Web Services Access HTTPS.

104
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,520
We're going to click on that.

105
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,400
And as you know, when we bring in a library,

106
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,040
it appears under the Custom tab as well as

107
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,720
in the location where the blocks belong by color.

108
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:39,300
And so here, we see that we've got this nice tool

109
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,020
called Listify.

110
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,140
So what Listify will do is take this list

111
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:47,120
of data that's in string format and convert it

112
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,060
into the nice list of list formats

113
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,460
that we're used to working with.

114
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,180
So let's try that again.

115
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,220
So I click on that.

116
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,620
And now we get this big list of lists.

117
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,940
So that is excellent.

118
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,220
But now the next thing that we need to do

119
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:04,380
is to convert this list of lists into something that

120
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,080
is a little bit more easy to use.

121
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,420
So you can see, if you click on one of the list of lists,

122
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:11,080
you see that it's country.

123
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,560
And then you can see here that the next one

124
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,840
is going to be name.

125
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,040
And then this is going to be latitude and longitude.

126
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,320
So we want to pull out the names right now.

127
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,320
So in order to do that, let's develop a block that

128
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,060
will pull out all the names and just make

129
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,400
a list only of the names.

130
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,760
OK, so let's go over to Variables here.

131
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:36,020
And remember, if we want to get an item of this list,

132
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:43,100
like item 2, which is going to be the first item here,

133
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,700
we don't want just the item 2 of the list.

134
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:52,500
We actually want item 2 of every item in the list.

135
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,900
So in order to do that, we're going

136
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,940
to have to use the Map block.

137
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,760
So let's go down to Map, which should be here.

138
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,160
Let's see here.

139
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,760
Map.

140
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:11,560
And we're going to map this item 2 over the entire list.

141
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,440
I can get that list.

142
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,840
Actually, sorry, it goes in here.

143
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,360
I'm going to move this over here.

144
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,960
I'm having trouble moving things today, obviously.

145
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,320
There we go.

146
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:26,760
Now, when we click this, notice that the empty slot is here.

147
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,220
So that's going to put each of these items in turn

148
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,260
into this map.

149
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:36,100
And we're going to pull out item 2, which should be the name.

150
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,580
So now we've got a list of all the names.

151
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,540
And you can see here just the names, no other detail.

152
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,820
But it's still a list of lists, even though it's

153
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,260
shown in tabular format.

154
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:49,500
And we'd really like to just get to a simple list of names.

155
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:54,460
So we can do that by doing another map if we want.

156
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,900
And let's do this here.

157
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:06,360
We're going to take this and put item here, item 2 of.

158
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,600
There we go.

159
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,120
Put it back into the map.

160
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,480
Let's run this.

161
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:18,320
And now we just have a list of 126,769 city names.

162
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,040
So that's perfect.

163
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:24,160
That's what we'll use as a basis of our exploration

164
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,660
of the cities of the world.

165
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,620
So now we just need to start setting up

166
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,040
the environment for this.

167
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,340
We're going to create a couple of variables to do that.

168
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,540
So I'm going to go over here.

169
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,640
And I'm going to make a variable called city.

170
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,340
And I'm also going to make a variable called cities.

171
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:43,940
Let's do that.

172
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:44,440
All right.

173
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,280
See if I can still click on this.

174
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,200
OK, there we go, cities.

175
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,640
And I don't need to show cities, per se.

176
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,640
I'm just going to show city.

177
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,880
Now, because this particular map is calling out

178
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,720
to this long list, we only want to call out to it once.

179
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,420
Basically, when the program starts,

180
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,380
we want to just call out and get that list.

181
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,900
So I'm going to go over to here.

182
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,540
And I'm going to say, when green flag is clicked.

183
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:27,540
And I'm going to set this variable here to this map.

184
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,220
OK, I'm going to drop this down.

185
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,220
I'm going to set cities to this map.

186
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,620
And so now, when the green flag is clicked,

187
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,260
we're going to populate this variable cities

188
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:41,220
with that list of 126,000 cities.

189
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,120
OK, so that's good.

190
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,760
And then we want to now start finding a random city

191
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,960
in that list to display.

192
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:53,720
So in our next set of blocks here,

193
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,040
let's do this one when we press the Space key.

194
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,160
So when we press the Space key, we

195
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,640
want to pull out a random city.

196
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,640
So let's get our variables here.

197
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:15,460
And we're going to set, here we go.

198
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:18,860
We're going to set city to.

199
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,060
And now, here's the question.

200
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,780
What do we set it to?

201
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:27,580
Well, we want to set it to a random item in that list.

202
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:32,180
So let's go over to our variables here.

203
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,380
We're already there.

204
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,800
And let's get to item.

205
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,840
Pull that over.

206
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,680
So item something of city.

207
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,520
So that far, we know.

208
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,760
OK, bring that over.

209
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,440
There we go.

210
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,760
OK, so we're going to do item something of cities.

211
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,740
But it should be a random number in the city list,

212
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,200
not just one or some other number that we pick.

213
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,960
Otherwise, we'll just do everything

214
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,440
in the same order, which wouldn't be any fun.

215
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:06,740
So to find a random, let's go over to Operators.

216
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,660
And here's a pick random.

217
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,700
Now, this will pick random numbers between 1 and 10.

218
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:16,940
But we need it to be between 1 and the 126,000.

219
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,780
So actually, to get the full list,

220
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,700
the full length of the list, we can go to Variables here.

221
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,700
And we can get length of.

222
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,460
And let's pull this over.

223
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,120
OK, there we go.

224
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,880
OK, so we've got length of.

225
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,040
And now, we want to put in length of the list of cities.

226
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,440
So now, it's going to pick a random between 1

227
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,980
and the length of the list of cities.

228
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,520
So if we click on this, we're expecting list,

229
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,920
but getting a number.

230
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,240
Oh, I think we need to set it first.

231
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,920
We haven't done that.

232
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:59,380
So now, it's set.

233
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,940
And let's see if we can pick it up.

234
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:01,460
There we go.

235
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,140
We should be getting random numbers.

236
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,060
And we are.

237
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,380
OK, so this is working.

238
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,420
And we're going to drop this in here.

239
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:10,500
So that will get us a random city from our list

240
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,020
and set it to the city variable.

241
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,460
Now, it should be as easy.

242
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,980
But I'll warn you in advance, not quite.

243
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:21,500
We're going to have to do one more piece of coding

244
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,180
to make this really work well.

245
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,680
So let's just try the naive approach, which

246
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:29,420
is going to drop city into here instead of Nashville.

247
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,500
And then we'll display it.

248
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,820
So let's see how that works.

249
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,860
OK, so we're immediately hitting a problem,

250
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,740
which says right here, sorry, we don't

251
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,420
have imagery for the city.

252
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:44,620
Sorry, sorry, there is an image.

253
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:48,620
So the problem is that there isn't a Google Street

254
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,900
View for every city in the world, sadly.

255
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,660
Not every city has been imaged by Google.

256
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,040
So for that reason, we need to filter our list

257
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,560
and remove the particular locations

258
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,260
in the world for which Google doesn't have images.

259
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,680
But we don't know that in advance.

260
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,600
We have to be able to query Google for that information.

261
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,960
So the way to query Google is to go back to our RPC

262
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,720
over here under Network.

263
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,600
And let's bring out this call block again.

264
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,160
And we're going to drop it back down to the Google Street View.

265
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,000
And then under Google Street View,

266
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:27,420
we're going to say isAvailableFromAddress.

267
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,580
Here we go, isAvailableFromAddress.

268
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,700
If I can get this to click, there we go.

269
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:37,220
OK, so isAvailableFromAddress will tell us, for example,

270
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:43,500
if we put in Nashville, and we'll do the 90, 90, 0,

271
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,620
it should come back as true.

272
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:51,180
But if we put in a city that doesn't exist, like Atlantis,

273
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,880
click on that, well, there must be an Atlantis

274
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,960
somewhere in the world.

275
00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:00,200
How about Porcupine, if I can spell that correctly?

276
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,600
OK, so a city of Porcupine does not exist.

277
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,080
So it should come back false.

278
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,800
So now we want to test, when we look up this random city,

279
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,680
does it exist?

280
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,520
And then show, and only then show,

281
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,840
that the city, the image of the city from Google Street View.

282
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:24,980
So in order to do that, we need to start by querying that first.

283
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,540
So I'm going to move this out of the way.

284
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,380
And here's what we need to do.

285
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,900
We need to do a loop, basically.

286
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,360
We're going to loop through until we

287
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,260
find a city for which Google says it has imagery.

288
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,460
Now, if you look under our control structures,

289
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,500
we have several loops that we can choose from.

290
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,900
So we have this repeatUntil block.

291
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,060
The question about this, though, is

292
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,540
we want to repeatUntil we meet a condition,

293
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,980
but we won't know what that condition is until we've

294
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,500
actually executed the block.

295
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,960
So we'd rather check for that Boolean flag

296
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,880
after we've run the code rather than before we've run the code.

297
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,420
Now, there are ways that we could make this repeatUntil block

298
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:02,040
work for us, but we don't have to, fortunately.

299
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,440
We can actually just go here into libraries again

300
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,280
and pick iteration composition.

301
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,880
I typed L-O-L for loop.

302
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,800
And we'll bring that in.

303
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,200
And you'll see that under the Custom tab here,

304
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,480
we now have a, let's see here.

305
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,460
repeatUntil that tests at the end

306
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,340
of the loop for a condition.

307
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,340
And that's what we'd like to use.

308
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:31,180
So let me bring that over here and plug it in.

309
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,900
And so what we're going to do then

310
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:40,580
is we're going to repeat this switch to costume.

311
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:44,740
Actually, let's set a variable here

312
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:47,940
so that we don't have to keep going through it again

313
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:48,740
and again.

314
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,360
Let's set a variable.

315
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:58,040
Let's do it as a script variable here.

316
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,960
And well, actually, I think we could just use city here.

317
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,880
So let's try this.

318
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,320
We'll just reuse it twice.

319
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,640
So OK, so we're going to set city to this.

320
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:14,640
And now we're going to ask, is that city available?

321
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:20,140
So we're going to put this block in here.

322
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:23,300
I'm going to bring this up here again.

323
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,900
Oh, there we go.

324
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:29,140
OK, so now we're going to repeat that particular operation

325
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:32,940
of looking to see if that city is available.

326
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,900
And then as soon as we get that this is true,

327
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,460
we'll pass on to the next block.

328
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:41,260
Now, the trick is we do need to do that Boolean comparison

329
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,980
here, so let's do that.

330
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,560
So we want to say until the city that we've called.

331
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,520
Here we go.

332
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,360
And let's move this over a little bit more

333
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,440
so you can see it is true.

334
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,120
So let's grab the true, false.

335
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:00,680
Here we go.

336
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,680
Here's true.

337
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,720
OK, there we go.

338
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,920
OK, so we're going to test to see if this is true.

339
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,800
But now, porcupine, as we've discovered, will never be true.

340
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,380
So we don't really want that.

341
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,940
We want to go back to our variables

342
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:19,580
and bring in city here.

343
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:23,620
So once we know that a city is true, then we can move on.

344
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:27,500
But it will repeat looking for cities randomly

345
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:32,060
until we know that there is a city at that address.

346
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,820
And then, and only then, will we switch to it.

347
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,660
So let's do that.

348
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:40,420
OK, so keep the same city variable.

349
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,340
That's why we didn't need to create a new one.

350
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,440
Let's try it.

351
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,320
So OK, we're going to populate our list again.

352
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,120
And then I'll hit a space key.

353
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,120
And I think we were in luck on the first one.

354
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,280
That was fine.

355
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,720
El Bon Pastor.

356
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,760
Delano.

357
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:00,360
Looks like someone's house in Delano.

358
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,260
OK, another city.

359
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,600
All going well.

360
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,840
Ah, but you notice here now we see some cycling going on.

361
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,000
It's looking for a city.

362
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,720
And finally, I think it found Stanford that it could pick.

363
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,620
And so there were several cities in a row

364
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:17,700
that it saw but didn't have information about.

365
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,340
So in order to prevent that kind of appearance of cycling,

366
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:23,180
although it's kind of a cool effect in itself,

367
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,180
we can just hide and show the variable.

368
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,580
So let me bring this over here.

369
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:29,500
Let's do show variable down here.

370
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:34,180
And let's do hide variable over here.

371
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,420
Here we go.

372
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,780
And I'm going to drop this down.

373
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,500
And it's the city variable that we want to hide.

374
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,520
And it's the city variable here that we want to show.

375
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:52,720
OK, now when I hit space key, it's still cycling a little bit.

376
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,480
Let's see why.

377
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,080
OK, so hide city variable.

378
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,040
Let's just try it here.

379
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,200
Should.

380
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,480
Oh, oh, oh, I think I've got it in the wrong spot.

381
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,220
We've reversed it, or I reversed it.

382
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,820
So let's take it and switch it around.

383
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,620
So there we go.

384
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:20,160
So we want to show the variable here.

385
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,740
Then we want to display the image on the stage.

386
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:31,060
And here is probably where we want to hide it

387
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,060
when we hit space key.

388
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:35,500
OK, so let's try that again.

389
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,400
So now it's showing a variable that actually has a city.

390
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,040
There we go.

391
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,680
There's another city.

392
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,800
There's another city.

393
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,520
There's a little bit of like you're

394
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,200
switching from the old variable name to the new variable name.

395
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,760
So we could probably fix that if we

396
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,000
wanted to just print this particular city

397
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,960
name on the screen.

398
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,400
But I think, in effect, we've got it working now.

399
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,760
So again, you could take this further

400
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,800
and make it into an actual game by adding an input block

401
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,340
and saying, can you guess what city this is?

402
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:10,940
With a list of 126,000 cities, that might be a difficult game.

403
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,740
But there are ways that you could perhaps

404
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,900
make it more interesting or more playable

405
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,660
by suggesting three names at random, one of them

406
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:20,620
being the true name, and then allow the players

407
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,940
to guess which name it is out of those three.

408
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:26,100
That would be, I think, a fairer game to play.

409
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,020
All right, but that's it for today.

410
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:28,820
Thank you very much.

411
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,340
And we'll continue this exploration

412
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:33,860
of mapping in Nest Blocks in our next video.
