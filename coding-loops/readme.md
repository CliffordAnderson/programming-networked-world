## Coding Loops

This lesson will discuss a fundamental control structure known as loops. Loops are a crucial part of programming as they help automate repetitive tasks, eliminating the need for blocks that repeat themselves repeatedly. Instead, these tasks can be placed inside a loop, which does the work for you. However, it's also important to understand how to stop a loop when you want to move on to another task. 

In this video, we will be discussing four types of loops. These loops can be found under control structures. The four types of loops we will be discussing are: forever, repeat, repeat until, and a loop with a variable. 

We will start with the forever loop. As the name suggests, a forever loop keeps going indefinitely. For instance, we would use a forever loop if we wanted a variable to count as high as possible. 

The next type of loop we will discuss is the repeat loop. Unlike the forever loop, the repeat loop is used when you want to do something a defined number of times. For example, if you want a task to be repeated ten times, you would use a repeat loop. It's important to note that the repeat loop will execute the task the specified number of times, regardless of the count variable. 

The third type of loop we will discuss is the repeat-until loop. This loop is used when you want to stop the loop based on a particular condition that you encounter within the loop. A common scenario for using this loop is when you want to repeat a task until you reach a certain threshold. For example, count up until you reach 15, then stop. 

Lastly, we discuss the for loop, a different type of loop incorporating a shortcut. Unlike the previous loops where we had to create a count variable, the 'for' loop has a built-in variable, typically called 'I.' This loop counts each time it goes through, saving us the extra step of setting and incrementing the counter. We then demonstrate how to use the 'for' loop by copying a piece of code and attaching a hat block to it. We observe that the counter automatically tracks where it is in the loop. The loop counts from one to ten and then stops. 

Finally, we conclude by emphasizing the efficiency of loops in programming. Whether you're counting up to a certain number or performing an operation a certain number of times, loops help set conditions about when to stop and when to move on. They can organize your program and prevent you from having to repeat blocks over and over again.
