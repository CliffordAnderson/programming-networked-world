# Introduction to Programming with Netsblocks

Hello everyone! In this lesson, we will be learning to program with *Netsblocks*, a visual programming language that builds upon the *Snap* programming language. It simplifies programming by using a block-based approach, which makes it both easy and fun for learners. This series of lessons will start with the basics of programming and gradually progress towards advanced concepts such as peer-to-peer networking and remote procedure calls. 

Before diving into the course, let's acknowledge the people and organizations whose work has greatly influenced this lesson. First and foremost, the developers of the Snap programming language, Jens Munich, and Brian Harvey, and the University of California, Berkeley, deserve our gratitude. *Netsblocks* extends the functionality of *Snap*, which is inspired by the visual vocabulary of *Scratch* and the semantics of *Scheme*. Moreover, the *Beauty and Joy of Computing* curriculum, which emphasizes aesthetics and playfulness in teaching computer science fundamentals, has also been a source of inspiration for this course material.

Lastly, I would like to express my appreciation to my colleagues at Vanderbilt University who have contributed to the development of *Netsblocks*. Special thanks go to Akos Ledeshi and Brian Broll, who have played significant roles in Netsblocks' progress as a unique programming language. Additionally, I acknowledge the creators of the friendly sprite, *Alonzo*, who will accompany us on this programming journey.
