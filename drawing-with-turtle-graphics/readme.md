# Introduction to Geometric Shapes in Turtle Graphics

In today's lesson, we will learn how to draw geometric shapes on the screen using *turtle graphics*, a concept developed by Seymour Papert for his Logo programming language. This method allows children to experiment with mathematical principles through programming. Our objective is to learn how to move sprites on a *Cartesian plane* and use *command blocks* in Netsblocks to create simple shapes like squares and triangles.

The main components we will use are the *motion blocks* and *pen blocks* in Netsblocks. We will learn how to control the direction and steps of the sprite using motion blocks and how to draw lines using pen blocks. We will create a square by combining these blocks and learn the importance of state management by using the *pen up* and *clear* blocks. This will help us understand the concept of *state* and *side effects*.

Once you grasp these basics, try experimenting with different shapes like triangles or polygons. In our next lesson, we will learn how to create circles and apply control structures to simplify and compact our code.

## Key takeaways from this lesson:
- Turtle graphics was developed by Seymour Papert as an environment for computational exploration.
- Sprites move on a Cartesian plane using x and y coordinates, and command blocks in Netsblocks control their movement and drawing of shapes.
- Motion blocks control the steps and direction of sprites, while pen blocks control the drawing of lines.
- State and side effects are essential concepts in programming as they affect how the sprite's environment changes with command blocks.
- Successfully learned to draw basic shapes like squares, triangles, and polygons using turtle graphics.
